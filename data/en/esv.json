So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.","31":"And the firstborn said to the younger, \"Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.","32":"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.\"","33":"So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.","34":"The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, \"Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.\"","35":"So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.","36":"Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.","37":"The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day.","38":"The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day."},"20":{"1":"From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar.","2":"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, \"She is my sister.\" And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.","3":"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, \"Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife.\"","4":"Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, \"Lord, will you kill an innocent people?","5":"Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.\"","6":"Then God said to him in the dream, \"Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her.","7":"Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you, and all who are yours.\"","8":"So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid.","9":"Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, \"What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.\"","10":"And Abimelech said to Abraham, \"What did you see, that you did this thing?\"","11":"Abraham said, \"I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.","12":"Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.","13":"And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother.'\"","14":"Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him.","15":"And Abimelech said, \"Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.\"","16":"To Sarah he said, \"Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.\"","17":"Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children.","18":"For the LORD had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."},"21":{"1":"The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised.","2":"And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him.","3":"Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac.","4":"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.","5":"Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.","6":"And Sarah said, \"God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.\"","7":"And she said, \"Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.\"","8":"And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.","9":"But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing.","10":"So she said to Abraham, \"Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.\"","11":"And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.","12":"But God said to Abraham, \"Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named.","13":"And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.\"","14":"So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.","15":"When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes.","16":"Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, \"Let me not look on the death of the child.\" And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.","17":"And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, \"What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.","18":"Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.\"","19":"Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.","20":"And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow.","21":"He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.","22":"At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, \"God is with you in all that you do.","23":"Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.\"","24":"And Abraham said, \"I will swear.\"","25":"When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized,","26":"Abimelech said, \"I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.\"","27":"So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.","28":"Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart.","29":"And Abimelech said to Abraham, \"What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?\"","30":"He said, \"These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.\"","31":"Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath.","32":"So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines.","33":"Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.","34":"And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines."},"22":{"1":"After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, \"Abraham!\" And he said, \"Here am I.\"","2":"He said, \"Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.\"","3":"So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.","4":"On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.","5":"Then Abraham said to his young men, \"Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.\"","6":"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.","7":"And Isaac said to his father Abraham, \"My father!\" And he said, \"Here am I, my son.\" He said, \"Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\"","8":"Abraham said, \"God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.\" So they went both of them together.","9":"When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.","10":"Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.","11":"But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, \"Abraham, Abraham!\" And he said, \"Here am I.\"","12":"He said, \"Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.\"","13":"And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son.","14":"So Abraham called the name of that place, \"The LORD will provide\"; as it is said to this day, \"On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.\"","15":"And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven","16":"and said, \"By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,","17":"I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies,","18":"and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.\"","19":"So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.","20":"Now after these things it was told to Abraham, \"Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:","21":"Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,","22":"Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\"","23":"(Bethuel fathered Rebekah.)

Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead.\"","7":"Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land.","8":"And he said to them, \"If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,","9":"that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place.\"","10":"Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city,","11":"\"No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.\"","12":"Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.","13":"And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, \"But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.\"","14":"Ephron answered Abraham,","15":"\"My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.\"","16":"Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.","17":"So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over","18":"to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city.","19":"After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.","20":"The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites."},"24":{"1":"Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years.

Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?\"","6":"Abraham said to him, \"See to it that you do not take my son back there.","7":"The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.","8":"But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.\"","9":"So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.","10":"Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor.","11":"And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water.","12":"And he said, \"O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.","13":"Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.","14":"Let the young woman to whom I shall say, 'Please let down your jar that I may drink,' and who shall say, 'Drink, and I will water your camels'--let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.\"","15":"Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder.","16":"The young woman was very attractive in appearance, a maiden whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.","17":"Then the servant ran to meet her and said, \"Please give me a little water to drink from your jar.\"","18":"She said, \"Drink, my lord.\" And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink.","19":"When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, \"I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.\"","20":"So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels.","21":"The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.","22":"When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,","23":"and said, \"Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?\"","24":"She said to him, \"I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.\"","25":"She added, \"We have plenty of both straw and fodder, and room to spend the night.\"","26":"The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD","27":"and said, \"Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen.\"","28":"Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household about these things.","29":"Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban.

For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.\"","32":"So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.","33":"Then food was set before him to eat.

Fear not, for I am with you and will bless you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake.\"","25":"So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.","26":"When Abimelech went to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army,","27":"Isaac said to them, \"Why have you come to me, seeing that you hate me and have sent me away from you?\"","28":"They said, \"We see plainly that the LORD has been with you. So we said, let there be a sworn pact between us, between you and us, and let us make a covenant with you,","29":"that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of the LORD.\"","30":"So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.","31":"In the morning they rose early and exchanged oaths. And Isaac sent them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.","32":"That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well that they had dug and said to him, \"We have found water.\"","33":"He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.","34":"When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite to be his wife, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite,","35":"and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah."},"27":{"1":"When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, \"My son\"; and he answered, \"Here I am.\"","2":"He said, \"Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.","3":"Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me,","4":"and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.\"","5":"Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,","6":"Rebekah said to her son Jacob, \"I heard your father speak to your brother Esau,","7":"'Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.'","8":"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you.","9":"Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves.","10":"And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.\"","11":"But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, \"Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.","12":"Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.\"","13":"His mother said to him, \"Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.\"","14":"So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved.","15":"Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.","16":"And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.","17":"And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.","18":"So he went in to his father and said, \"My father.\" And he said, \"Here I am. Who are you, my son?\"","19":"Jacob said to his father, \"I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.\"","20":"But Isaac said to his son, \"How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?\" He answered, \"Because the LORD your God granted me success.\"","21":"Then Isaac said to Jacob, \"Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.\"","22":"So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, \"The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\"","23":"And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.","24":"He said, \"Are you really my son Esau?\" He answered, \"I am.\"","25":"Then he said, \"Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you.\" So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.","26":"Then his father Isaac said to him, \"Come near and kiss me, my son.\"","27":"So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said, \"See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed!","28":"May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and wine.","29":"Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be everyone who blesses you!\"","30":"As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.","31":"He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, \"Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me.\"","32":"His father Isaac said to him, \"Who are you?\" He answered, \"I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.\"","33":"Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, \"Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.\"","34":"As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, \"Bless me, even me also, O my father!\"","35":"But he said, \"Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.\"","36":"Esau said, \"Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.\" Then he said, \"Have you not reserved a blessing for me?\"","37":"Isaac answered and said to Esau, \"Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?\"","38":"Esau said to his father, \"Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.\" And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.","39":"Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: \"Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven on high.","40":"By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you grow restless you shall break his yoke from your neck.\"","41":"Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, \"The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.\"","42":"But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, \"Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.","43":"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran","44":"and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away--","45":"until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?\"","46":"Then Rebekah said to Isaac, \"I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?\""},"28":{"1":"Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and directed him, \"You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women.","2":"Arise, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel your mother's father, and take as your wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.","3":"God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.","4":"May he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings that God gave to Abraham!\"","5":"Thus Isaac sent Jacob away. And he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.","6":"Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he directed him, \"You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women,\"","7":"and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram.","8":"So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father,","9":"Esau went to Ishmael and took as his wife, besides the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth.","10":"Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran.","11":"And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep.","12":"And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!","13":"And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, \"I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring.","14":"Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.","15":"Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.\"","16":"Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, \"Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.\"","17":"And he was afraid and said, \"How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\"","18":"So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.","19":"He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.","20":"Then Jacob made a vow, saying, \"If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,","21":"so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God,","22":"and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.\""},"29":{"1":"Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east.","2":"As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large,","3":"and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.","4":"Jacob said to them, \"My brothers, where do you come from?\" They said, \"We are from Haran.\"","5":"He said to them, \"Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?\" They said, \"We know him.\"","6":"He said to them, \"Is it well with him?\" They said, \"It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!\"","7":"He said, \"Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them.\"","8":"But they said, \"We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.\"","9":"While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.","10":"Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.","11":"Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.","12":"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her father.","13":"As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,","14":"and Laban said to him, \"Surely you are my bone and my flesh!\" And he stayed with him a month.","15":"Then Laban said to Jacob, \"Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?\"","16":"Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.","17":"Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance.","18":"Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, \"I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.\"","19":"Laban said, \"It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.\"","20":"So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.","21":"Then Jacob said to Laban, \"Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.\"","22":"So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast.","23":"But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her.","24":"(Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.)","25":"And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, \"What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?\"","26":"Laban said, \"It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.","27":"Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.\"","28":"Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.","29":"(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.)","30":"So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.","31":"When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.","32":"And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, \"Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.\"","33":"She conceived again and bore a son, and said, \"Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also.\" And she called his name Simeon.","34":"Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, \"Now this time my husband will be attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.\" Therefore his name was called Levi.","35":"And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, \"This time I will praise the LORD.\" Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she ceased bearing."},"30":{"1":"When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she envied her sister. She said to Jacob, \"Give me children, or I shall die!\"","2":"Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, \"Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?\"","3":"Then she said, \"Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, so that she may give birth on my behalf, that even I may have children through her.\"","4":"So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.","5":"And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.","6":"Then Rachel said, \"God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son.\" Therefore she called his name Dan.","7":"Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.","8":"Then Rachel said, \"With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed.\" So she called his name Naphtali.","9":"When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.","10":"Then Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.","11":"And Leah said, \"Good fortune has come!\" so she called his name Gad.","12":"Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.","13":"And Leah said, \"Happy am I! For women have called me happy.\" So she called his name Asher.","14":"In the days of wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, \"Please give me some of your son's mandrakes.\"","15":"But she said to her, \"Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?\" Rachel said, \"Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes.\"","16":"When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, \"You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son's mandrakes.\" So he lay with her that night.","17":"And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.","18":"Leah said, \"God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband.\" So she called his name Issachar.","19":"And Leah conceived again, and she bore Jacob a sixth son.","20":"Then Leah said, \"God has endowed me with a good endowment; now my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons.\" So she called his name Zebulun.","21":"Afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.","22":"Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.","23":"She conceived and bore a son and said, \"God has taken away my reproach.\"","24":"And she called his name Joseph, saying, \"May the LORD add to me another son!\"","25":"As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, \"Send me away, that I may go to my own home and country.","26":"Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know the service that I have given you.\"","27":"But Laban said to him, \"If I have found favor in your sight, I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.","28":"Name your wages, and I will give it.\"","29":"Jacob said to him, \"You yourself know how I have served you, and how your livestock has fared with me.","30":"For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own household also?\"","31":"He said, \"What shall I give you?\" Jacob said, \"You shall not give me anything. If you will do this for me, I will again pasture your flock and keep it:","32":"let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and they shall be my wages.","33":"So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted stolen.\"","34":"Laban said, \"Good! Let it be as you have said.\"","35":"But that day Laban removed the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them in charge of his sons.","36":"And he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob pastured the rest of Laban's flock.","37":"Then Jacob took fresh sticks of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the sticks.","38":"He set the sticks that he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, the watering places, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,","39":"the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.","40":"And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban's flock.","41":"Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks,","42":"but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.","43":"Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys."},"31":{"1":"Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, \"Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and from what was our father's he has gained all this wealth.\"","2":"And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.","3":"Then the LORD said to Jacob, \"Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.\"","4":"So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was","5":"and said to them, \"I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.","6":"You know that I have served your father with all my strength,","7":"yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God did not permit him to harm me.","8":"If he said, 'The spotted shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped.","9":"Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.","10":"In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.","11":"Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am!'","12":"And he said, 'Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.","13":"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.'\"","14":"Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, \"Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?","15":"Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money.","16":"All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.\"","17":"So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.","18":"He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.","19":"Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods.","20":"And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee.","21":"He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.","22":"When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,","23":"he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.","24":"But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, \"Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.\"","25":"And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead.","26":"And Laban said to Jacob, \"What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?","27":"Why did you flee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?","28":"And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.","29":"It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'","30":"And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you steal my gods?\"","31":"Jacob answered and said to Laban, \"Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.","32":"Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it.\" Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.","33":"So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's.","34":"Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them.","35":"And she said to her father, \"Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me.\" So he searched but did not find the household gods.","36":"Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, \"What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?","37":"For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.","38":"These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.","39":"What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.","40":"There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.","41":"These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.","42":"If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.\"","43":"Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, \"The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne?","44":"Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me.\"","45":"So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.","46":"And Jacob said to his kinsmen, \"Gather stones.\" And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.","47":"Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.","48":"Laban said, \"This heap is a witness between you and me today.\" Therefore he named it Galeed,","49":"and Mizpah, for he said, \"The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight.","50":"If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.\"","51":"Then Laban said to Jacob, \"See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me.","52":"This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm.","53":"The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.\" So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,","54":"and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.","55":"Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home."},"32":{"1":"Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.","2":"And when Jacob saw them he said, \"This is God's camp!\" So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.","3":"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,","4":"instructing them, \"Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, 'I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now.","5":"I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.'\"","6":"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, \"We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.\"","7":"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps,","8":"thinking, \"If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape.\"","9":"And Jacob said, \"O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,'","10":"I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.","11":"Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children.","12":"But you said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'\"","13":"So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau,","14":"two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,","15":"thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.","16":"These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, \"Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove.\"","17":"He instructed the first, \"When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, 'To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these ahead of you?'","18":"then you shall say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent to my lord Esau. And moreover, he is behind us.'\"","19":"He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, \"You shall say the same thing to Esau when you find him,","20":"and you shall say, 'Moreover, your servant Jacob is behind us.'\" For he thought, \"I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.\"","21":"So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.","22":"The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.","23":"He took them and sent them across the stream, and everything else that he had.","24":"And Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.","25":"When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched his hip socket, and Jacob's hip was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.","26":"Then he said, \"Let me go, for the day has broken.\" But Jacob said, \"I will not let you go unless you bless me.\"","27":"And he said to him, \"What is your name?\" And he said, \"Jacob.\"","28":"Then he said, \"Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.\"","29":"Then Jacob asked him, \"Please tell me your name.\" But he said, \"Why is it that you ask my name?\" And there he blessed him.","30":"So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, \"For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been delivered.\"","31":"The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping because of his hip.","32":"Therefore to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket, because he touched the socket of Jacob's hip on the sinew of the thigh."},"33":{"1":"And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants.","2":"And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all.","3":"He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.","4":"But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.","5":"And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, \"Who are these with you?\" Jacob said, \"The children whom God has graciously given your servant.\"","6":"Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down.","7":"Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down.","8":"Esau said, \"What do you mean by all this company that I met?\" Jacob answered, \"To find favor in the sight of my lord.\"","9":"But Esau said, \"I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.\"","10":"Jacob said, \"No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me.","11":"Please accept my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.\" Thus he urged him, and he took it.","12":"Then Esau said, \"Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of you.\"","13":"But Jacob said to him, \"My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die.","14":"Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.\"","15":"So Esau said, \"Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.\" But he said, \"What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.\"","16":"So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.","17":"But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.","18":"And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, on his way from Paddan-aram, and he camped before the city.","19":"And from the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, he bought for a hundred pieces of money the piece of land on which he had pitched his tent.","20":"There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel."},"34":{"1":"Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the women of the land.","2":"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her.","3":"And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.","4":"So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, \"Get me this girl for my wife.\"","5":"Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came.","6":"And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.","7":"The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing must not be done.","8":"But Hamor spoke with them, saying, \"The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him to be his wife.","9":"Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.","10":"You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be open to you. Dwell and trade in it, and get property in it.\"","11":"Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, \"Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.","12":"Ask me for as great a bride price and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife.\"","13":"The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.","14":"They said to them, \"We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us.","15":"Only on this condition will we agree with you--that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised.","16":"Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people.","17":"But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.\"","18":"Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor's son Shechem.","19":"And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his father's house.","20":"So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,","21":"\"These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give them our daughters.","22":"Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us to become one people--when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.","23":"Will not their livestock, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us.\"","24":"And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.","25":"On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males.","26":"They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went away.","27":"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.","28":"They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field.","29":"All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered.","30":"Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, \"You have brought trouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.\"","31":"But they said, \"Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?\""},"35":{"1":"God said to Jacob, \"Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.\"","2":"So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, \"Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments.","3":"Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.\"","4":"So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.","5":"And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.","6":"And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,","7":"and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.","8":"And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth.","9":"God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.","10":"And God said to him, \"Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.\" So he called his name Israel.","11":"And God said to him, \"I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body.","12":"The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.\"","13":"Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.","14":"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.","15":"So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.","16":"Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor.","17":"And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, \"Do not fear, for you have another son.\"","18":"And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.","19":"So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),","20":"and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.","21":"Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.","22":"While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard of it.Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.","23":"The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.","24":"The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.","25":"The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali.","26":"The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.","27":"And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.","28":"Now the days of Isaac were 180 years.","29":"And Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days.

Whatever was done there, he was the one who did it.","23":"The keeper of the prison paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph's charge, because the LORD was with him. And whatever he did, the LORD made it succeed."},"40":{"1":"Some time after this, the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and his baker committed an offense against their lord the king of Egypt.","2":"And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,","3":"and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.","4":"The captain of the guard appointed Joseph to be with them, and he attended them. They continued for some time in custody.","5":"And one night they both dreamed--the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison--each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation.","6":"When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled.","7":"So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, \"Why are your faces downcast today?\"","8":"They said to him, \"We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.\" And Joseph said to them, \"Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell them to me.\"","9":"So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, \"In my dream there was a vine before me,","10":"and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.","11":"Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.\"","12":"Then Joseph said to him, \"This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days.","13":"In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer.","14":"Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.","15":"For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit.\"","16":"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, \"I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,","17":"and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head.\"","18":"And Joseph answered and said, \"This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days.","19":"In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head--from you!--and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat the flesh from you.\"","20":"On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants and lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.","21":"He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand.","22":"But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.","23":"Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him."},"41":{"1":"After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,","2":"and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows attractive and plump, and they fed in the reed grass.","3":"And behold, seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.","4":"And the ugly, thin cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke.","5":"And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.","6":"And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind.","7":"And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.","8":"So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.","9":"Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, \"I remember my offenses today.","10":"When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,","11":"we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation.","12":"A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream.","13":"And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.\"","14":"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.","15":"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.\"","16":"Joseph answered Pharaoh, \"It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.\"","17":"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile.","18":"Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass.","19":"Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.","20":"And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows,","21":"but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke.","22":"I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good.","23":"Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them,","24":"and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.\"","25":"Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, \"The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.","26":"The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one.","27":"The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine.","28":"It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.","29":"There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,","30":"but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,","31":"and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe.","32":"And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about.","33":"Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.","34":"Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plentiful years.","35":"And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.","36":"That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.\"","37":"This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants.","38":"And Pharaoh said to his servants, \"Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?\"","39":"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are.","40":"You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.\"","41":"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.\"","42":"Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck.","43":"And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, \"Bow the knee!\" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.","44":"Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.\"","45":"And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.","46":"Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt.","47":"During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly,","48":"and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it.","49":"And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.","50":"Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him.","51":"Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. \"For,\" he said, \"God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house.\"","52":"The name of the second he called Ephraim, \"For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.\"","53":"The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end,","54":"and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.","55":"When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, \"Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.\"","56":"So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.","57":"Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth."},"42":{"1":"When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, \"Why do you look at one another?\"","2":"And he said, \"Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die.\"","3":"So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.","4":"But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him.","5":"Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.","6":"Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.","7":"Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. \"Where do you come from?\" he said. They said, \"From the land of Canaan, to buy food.\"","8":"And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.","9":"And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, \"You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.\"","10":"They said to him, \"No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food.","11":"We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies.\"","12":"He said to them, \"No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see.\"","13":"And they said, \"We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.\"","14":"But Joseph said to them, \"It is as I said to you. You are spies.","15":"By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.","16":"Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.\"","17":"And he put them all together in custody for three days.","18":"On the third day Joseph said to them, \"Do this and you will live, for I fear God:","19":"if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households,","20":"and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die.\" And they did so.","21":"Then they said to one another, \"In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.\"","22":"And Reuben answered them, \"Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.\"","23":"They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them.","24":"Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.","25":"And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man's money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.","26":"Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed.","27":"And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack.","28":"He said to his brothers, \"My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!\" At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, \"What is this that God has done to us?\"","29":"When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,","30":"\"The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land.","31":"But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we have never been spies.","32":"We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'","33":"Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way.","34":"Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.'\"","35":"As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.","36":"And Jacob their father said to them, \"You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.\"","37":"Then Reuben said to his father, \"Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.\"","38":"But he said, \"My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.\""},"43":{"1":"Now the famine was severe in the land.","2":"And when they had eaten the grain that they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, \"Go again, buy us a little food.\"","3":"But Judah said to him, \"The man solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.'","4":"If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.","5":"But if you will not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'\"","6":"Israel said, \"Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?\"","7":"They replied, \"The man questioned us carefully about ourselves and our kindred, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' What we told him was in answer to these questions. Could we in any way know that he would say, 'Bring your brother down'?\"","8":"And Judah said to Israel his father, \"Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.","9":"I will be a pledge of his safety. From my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever.","10":"If we had not delayed, we would now have returned twice.\"","11":"Then their father Israel said to them, \"If it must be so, then do this: take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the man, a little balm and a little honey, gum, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.","12":"Take double the money with you. Carry back with you the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.","13":"Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man.","14":"May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, and may he send back your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.\"","15":"So the men took this present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin. They arose and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.","16":"When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, \"Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon.\"","17":"The man did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph's house.","18":"And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, \"It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may assault us and fall upon us to make us servants and seize our donkeys.\"","19":"So they went up to the steward of Joseph's house and spoke with him at the door of the house,","20":"and said, \"Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food.","21":"And when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was each man's money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. So we have brought it again with us,","22":"and we have brought other money down with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.\"","23":"He replied, \"Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has put treasure in your sacks for you. I received your money.\" Then he brought Simeon out to them.","24":"And when the man had brought the men into Joseph's house and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their donkeys fodder,","25":"they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.","26":"When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present that they had with them and bowed down to him to the ground.","27":"And he inquired about their welfare and said, \"Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?\"","28":"They said, \"Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.\" And they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.","29":"And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, \"Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!\"","30":"Then Joseph hurried out, for his compassion grew warm for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there.","31":"Then he washed his face and came out. And controlling himself he said, \"Serve the food.\"","32":"They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.","33":"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth. And the men looked at one another in amazement.","34":"Portions were taken to them from Joseph's table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him."},"44":{"1":"Then he commanded the steward of his house, \"Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack,","2":"and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.\" And he did as Joseph told him.","3":"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys.","4":"They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, \"Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good?","5":"Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.'\"","6":"When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words.","7":"They said to him, \"Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!","8":"Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?","9":"Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord's servants.\"","10":"He said, \"Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent.\"","11":"Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.","12":"And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.","13":"Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.","14":"When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground.","15":"Joseph said to them, \"What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?\"","16":"And Judah said, \"What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord's servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.\"","17":"But he said, \"Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.\"","18":"Then Judah went up to him and said, \"O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself.","19":"My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father, or a brother?'","20":"And we said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and his father loves him.'","21":"Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.'","22":"We said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'","23":"Then you said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.'","24":"\"When we went back to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.","25":"And when our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food,'","26":"we said, 'We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'","27":"Then your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.","28":"One left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces, and I have never seen him since.","29":"If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.'","30":"\"Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy's life,","31":"as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.","32":"For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.'","33":"Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers.","34":"For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father.\""},"45":{"1":"Then Joseph could not control himself before all those who stood by him. He cried, \"Make everyone go out from me.\" So no one stayed with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.","2":"And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.","3":"And Joseph said to his brothers, \"I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?\" But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.","4":"So Joseph said to his brothers, \"Come near to me, please.\" And they came near. And he said, \"I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.","5":"And now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.","6":"For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.","7":"And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors.","8":"So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.","9":"Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not tarry.","10":"You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, and your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.","11":"There I will provide for you, for there are yet five years of famine to come, so that you and your household, and all that you have, do not come to poverty.'","12":"And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.","13":"You must tell my father of all my honor in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. Hurry and bring my father down here.\"","14":"Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.","15":"And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. After that his brothers talked with him.","16":"When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, \"Joseph's brothers have come,\" it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.","17":"And Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan,","18":"and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.'","19":"And you, Joseph, are commanded to say, 'Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.","20":"Have no concern for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'\"","21":"The sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.","22":"To each and all of them he gave a change of clothes, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five changes of clothes.","23":"To his father he sent as follows: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provision for his father on the journey.","24":"Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, \"Do not quarrel on the way.\"","25":"So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to their father Jacob.","26":"And they told him, \"Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.\" And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them.","27":"But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.","28":"And Israel said, \"It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.\""},"46":{"1":"So Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.","2":"And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, \"Jacob, Jacob.\" And he said, \"Here am I.\"","3":"Then he said, \"I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.","4":"I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph's hand shall close your eyes.\"","5":"Then Jacob set out from Beersheba. The sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him.","6":"They also took their livestock and their goods, which they had gained in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him,","7":"his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters.

And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.","18":"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bore to Jacob--sixteen persons.","19":"The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.","20":"And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, bore to him.","21":"And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.","22":"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob--fourteen persons in all.","23":"The sons of Dan: Hushim.","24":"The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.","25":"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob--seven persons in all.","26":"All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own descendants, not including Jacob's sons' wives, were sixty-six persons in all.","27":"And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two. All the persons of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy.","28":"He had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to show the way before him in Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen.","29":"Then Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen. He presented himself to him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.","30":"Israel said to Joseph, \"Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.\"","31":"Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, \"I will go up and tell Pharaoh and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.","32":"And the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.'","33":"When Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?'","34":"you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers,' in order that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.\""},"47":{"1":"So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, \"My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen.\"","2":"And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh.","3":"Pharaoh said to his brothers, \"What is your occupation?\" And they said to Pharaoh, \"Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were.\"","4":"They said to Pharaoh, \"We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.\"","5":"Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Your father and your brothers have come to you.","6":"The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them settle in the land of Goshen, and if you know any able men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.\"","7":"Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and stood him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.","8":"And Pharaoh said to Jacob, \"How many are the days of the years of your life?\"","9":"And Jacob said to Pharaoh, \"The days of the years of my sojourning are 130 years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning.\"","10":"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.","11":"Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.","12":"And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their dependents.","13":"Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine.","14":"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, in exchange for the grain that they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.","15":"And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, \"Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone.\"","16":"And Joseph answered, \"Give your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone.\"","17":"So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the donkeys. He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.","18":"And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year and said to him, \"We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent. The herds of livestock are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land.","19":"Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.\"","20":"So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe on them. The land became Pharaoh's.","21":"As for the people, he made servants of them from one end of Egypt to the other.","22":"Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.","23":"Then Joseph said to the people, \"Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.","24":"And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones.\"","25":"And they said, \"You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh.\"","26":"So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.","27":"Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly.","28":"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years.","29":"And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, \"If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt,","30":"but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.\" He answered, \"I will do as you have said.\"","31":"And he said, \"Swear to me\"; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed."},"48":{"1":"After this, Joseph was told, \"Behold, your father is ill.\" So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.","2":"And it was told to Jacob, \"Your son Joseph has come to you.\" Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed.","3":"And Jacob said to Joseph, \"God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,","4":"and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.'","5":"And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.","6":"And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.","7":"As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).\"","8":"When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, \"Who are these?\"","9":"Joseph said to his father, \"They are my sons, whom God has given me here.\" And he said, \"Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.\"","10":"Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them.","11":"And Israel said to Joseph, \"I never expected to see your face; and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.\"","12":"Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.","13":"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him.","14":"And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn).","15":"And he blessed Joseph and said, \"The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day,","16":"the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; and in them let my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.\"","17":"When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.","18":"And Joseph said to his father, \"Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head.\"","19":"But his father refused and said, \"I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.\"","20":"So he blessed them that day, saying, \"By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.'\"Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh.","21":"Then Israel said to Joseph, \"Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.","22":"Moreover, I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.\""},"49":{"1":"Then Jacob called his sons and said, \"Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come.","2":"\"Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob, listen to Israel your father.","3":"\"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the firstfruits of my strength, preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.","4":"Unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it--he went up to my couch!","5":"\"Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords.","6":"Let my soul come not into their council; O my glory, be not joined to their company.

It was then that she said, \"A bridegroom of blood,\" because of the circumcision.","27":"The LORD said to Aaron, \"Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.\" So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.","28":"And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him to speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do.","29":"Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel.","30":"Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people.","31":"And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped."},"5":{"1":"Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, \"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'\"","2":"But Pharaoh said, \"Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go?

No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.\"","19":"The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, \"You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day.\"","20":"They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh;","21":"and they said to them, \"The LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.\"","22":"Then Moses turned to the LORD and said, \"O LORD, why have you done evil to this people?

So be very careful.","5":"Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.","6":"You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.","7":"For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He knows your going through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.\"'","8":"So we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and Ezion-geber.\"And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab.","9":"And the LORD said to me, 'Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the people of Lot for a possession.'","10":"(The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim.","11":"Like the Anakim they are also counted as Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim.","12":"The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the LORD gave to them.)","13":"'Now rise up and go over the brook Zered.' So we went over the brook Zered.","14":"And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.","15":"For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished.","16":"\"So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people,","17":"the LORD said to me,","18":"'Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar.","19":"And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.'","20":"(It is also counted as a land of Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there--but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim--","21":"a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before the Ammonites, and they dispossessed them and settled in their place,","22":"as he did for the people of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day.","23":"As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)","24":"'Rise up, set out on your journey and go over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle.","25":"This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'","26":"\"So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,","27":"'Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.","28":"You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot,","29":"as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving to us.'","30":"But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might give him into your hand, as he is this day.","31":"And the LORD said to me, 'Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may occupy his land.'","32":"Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.","33":"And the LORD our God gave him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and all his people.","34":"And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction every city, men, women, and children. We left no survivors.","35":"Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities that we captured.","36":"From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. The LORD our God gave all into our hands.","37":"Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, whatever the LORD our God had forbidden us."},"3":{"1":"\"Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.","2":"But the LORD said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.'","3":"So the LORD our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, and we struck him down until he had no survivor left.","4":"And we took all his cities at that time--there was not a city that we did not take from them--sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.","5":"All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages.","6":"And we devoted them to destruction, as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every city, men, women, and children.","7":"But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder.","8":"So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon","9":"(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, while the Amorites call it Senir),","10":"all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.","11":"(For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bed was a bed of iron. Is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the common cubit. )","12":"\"When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities.","13":"The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All that portion of Bashan is called the land of Rephaim.","14":"Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called the villages after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.)","15":"To Machir I gave Gilead,","16":"and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far over as the river Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites;","17":"the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.","18":"\"And I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The LORD your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of valor shall cross over armed before your brothers, the people of Israel.","19":"Only your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in the cities that I have given you,","20":"until the LORD gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also occupy the land that the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.'","21":"And I commanded Joshua at that time, 'Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. So will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing.","22":"You shall not fear them, for it is the LORD your God who fights for you.'","23":"\"And I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying,","24":"'O Lord GOD, you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours?","25":"Please let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.'","26":"But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. And the LORD said to me, 'Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again.","27":"Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and look at it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan.","28":"But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see.'","29":"So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor."},"4":{"1":"\"And now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the rules that I am teaching you, and do them, that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.","2":"You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you.","3":"Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all the men who followed the Baal of Peor.","4":"But you who held fast to the LORD your God are all alive today.","5":"See, I have taught you statutes and rules, as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do them in the land that you are entering to take possession of it.","6":"Keep them and do them, for that will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'","7":"For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is to us, whenever we call upon him?","8":"And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today?","9":"\"Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life.

But you shall go over and take possession of that good land.","23":"Take care, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make a carved image, the form of anything that the LORD your God has forbidden you.","24":"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.","25":"\"When you father children and children's children, and have grown old in the land, if you act corruptly by making a carved image in the form of anything, and by doing what is evil in the sight of the LORD your God, so as to provoke him to anger,","26":"I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess.

Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.","25":"But Rahab the prostitute and her father's household and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive. And she has lived in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.","26":"Joshua laid an oath on them at that time, saying, \"Cursed before the LORD be the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho. \"At the cost of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest son shall he set up its gates.\"","27":"So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land."},"7":{"1":"But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the LORD burned against the people of Israel.","2":"Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, \"Go up and spy out the land.\" And the men went up and spied out Ai.","3":"And they returned to Joshua and said to him, \"Do not have all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are few.\"","4":"So about 3,000 men went up there from the people. And they fled before the men of Ai,","5":"and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of their men and chased them before the gate as far as Shebarim and struck them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became as water.","6":"Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they put dust on their heads.","7":"And Joshua said, \"Alas, O Lord GOD, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!","8":"O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!","9":"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will you do for your great name?\"","10":"The LORD said to Joshua, \"Get up! Why have you fallen on your face?","11":"Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant that I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen and lied and put them among their own belongings.","12":"Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.","13":"Get up! Consecrate the people and say, 'Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, God of Israel, \"There are devoted things in your midst, O Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things from among you.\"","14":"In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot shall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near by households. And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by man.","15":"And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done an outrageous thing in Israel.'\"","16":"So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken.","17":"And he brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahites was taken. And he brought near the clan of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.","18":"And he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.","19":"Then Joshua said to Achan, \"My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel and give praise to him. And tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.\"","20":"And Achan answered Joshua, \"Truly I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I did:","21":"when I saw among the spoil a beautiful cloak from Shinar, and 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels, then I coveted them and took them. And see, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath.\"","22":"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.","23":"And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the people of Israel. And they laid them down before the LORD.","24":"And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters and his oxen and donkeys and sheep and his tent and all that he had. And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.","25":"And Joshua said, \"Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD brings trouble on you today.\" And all Israel stoned him with stones. They burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.","26":"And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore, to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor."},"8":{"1":"And the LORD said to Joshua, \"Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Take all the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land.","2":"And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoil and its livestock you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush against the city, behind it.\"","3":"So Joshua and all the fighting men arose to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out by night.","4":"And he commanded them, \"Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you remain ready.","5":"And I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out against us just as before, we shall flee before them.","6":"And they will come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city. For they will say, 'They are fleeing from us, just as before.' So we will flee before them.","7":"Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will give it into your hand.","8":"And as soon as you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire. You shall do according to the word of the Lord. See, I have commanded you.\"","9":"So Joshua sent them out. And they went to the place of ambush and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai, but Joshua spent that night among the people.","10":"Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.","11":"And all the fighting men who were with him went up and drew near before the city and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai.","12":"He took about 5,000 men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.","13":"So they stationed the forces, the main encampment that was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley.","14":"And as soon as the king of Ai saw this, he and all his people, the men of the city, hurried and went out early to the appointed place toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.","15":"And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness.","16":"So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city.","17":"Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel. They left the city open and pursued Israel.","18":"Then the LORD said to Joshua, \"Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.\" And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.","19":"And the men in the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it. And they hurried to set the city on fire.","20":"So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people who fled to the wilderness turned back against the pursuers.","21":"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.","22":"And the others came out from the city against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side. And Israel struck them down, until there was left none that survived or escaped.","23":"But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him near to Joshua.","24":"When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them, and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the edge of the sword.","25":"And all who fell that day, both men and women, were 12,000, all the people of Ai.","26":"But Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to destruction.","27":"Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took as their plunder, according to the word of the LORD that he commanded Joshua.","28":"So Joshua burned Ai and made it forever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day.","29":"And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening. And at sunset Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.","30":"At that time Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,","31":"just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, \"an altar of uncut stones, upon which no man has wielded an iron tool.\" And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings.","32":"And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.","33":"And all Israel, sojourner as well as native born, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first, to bless the people of Israel.","34":"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.","35":"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them."},"9":{"1":"As soon as all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, heard of this,","2":"they gathered together as one to fight against Joshua and Israel.","3":"But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,","4":"they on their part acted with cunning and went and made ready provisions and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended,","5":"with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes. And all their provisions were dry and crumbly.","6":"And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, \"We have come from a distant country, so now make a covenant with us.\"","7":"But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, \"Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?\"","8":"They said to Joshua, \"We are your servants.\" And Joshua said to them, \"Who are you? And where do you come from?\"","9":"They said to him, \"From a very distant country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God. For we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt,","10":"and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.","11":"So our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, 'Take provisions in your hand for the journey and go to meet them and say to them, \"We are your servants. Come now, make a covenant with us.\"'","12":"Here is our bread. It was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey on the day we set out to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and crumbly.","13":"These wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they have burst. And these garments and sandals of ours are worn out from the very long journey.\"","14":"So the men took some of their provisions, but did not ask counsel from the LORD.","15":"And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.","16":"At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors and that they lived among them.","17":"And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.","18":"But the people of Israel did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders.","19":"But all the leaders said to all the congregation, \"We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.","20":"This we will do to them: let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath that we swore to them.\"","21":"And the leaders said to them, \"Let them live.\" So they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, just as the leaders had said of them.","22":"Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, \"Why did you deceive us, saying, 'We are very far from you,' when you dwell among us?","23":"Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall never be anything but servants, cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.\"","24":"They answered Joshua, \"Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you--so we feared greatly for our lives because of you and did this thing.","25":"And now, behold, we are in your hand. Whatever seems good and right in your sight to do to us, do it.\"","26":"So he did this to them and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel, and they did not kill them.","27":"But Joshua made them that day cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place that he should choose."},"10":{"1":"As soon as Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it to destruction, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,","2":"he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors.","3":"So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,","4":"\"Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon. For it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel.\"","5":"Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon and made war against it.","6":"And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, \"Do not relax your hand from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us.\"","7":"So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.","8":"And the LORD said to Joshua, \"Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands. Not a man of them shall stand before you.\"","9":"So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal.","10":"And the LORD threw them into a panic before Israel, who struck them with a great blow at Gibeon and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah.","11":"And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw down large stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones than the sons of Israel killed with the sword.","12":"At that time Joshua spoke to the LORD in the day when the LORD gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, \"Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.\"","13":"And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies.Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stopped in the midst of heaven and did not hurry to set for about a whole day.","14":"There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD obeyed the voice of a man, for the LORD fought for Israel.","15":"So Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.","16":"These five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.","17":"And it was told to Joshua, \"The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.\"","18":"And Joshua said, \"Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them,","19":"but do not stay there yourselves. Pursue your enemies; attack their rear guard. Do not let them enter their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand.\"","20":"When Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them with a great blow until they were wiped out, and when the remnant that remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,","21":"then all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. Not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.","22":"Then Joshua said, \"Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me from the cave.\"","23":"And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.","24":"And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, \"Come near; put your feet on the necks of these kings.\" Then they came near and put their feet on their necks.","25":"And Joshua said to them, \"Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous. For thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.\"","26":"And afterward Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hanged them on five trees. And they hung on the trees until evening.","27":"But at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set large stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.","28":"As for Makkedah, Joshua captured it on that day and struck it, and its king, with the edge of the sword. He devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. And he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.","29":"Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against Libnah.","30":"And the LORD gave it also and its king into the hand of Israel. And he struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it; he left none remaining in it. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.","31":"Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Libnah to Lachish and laid siege to it and fought against it.","32":"And the LORD gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword, and every person in it, as he had done to Libnah.","33":"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish. And Joshua struck him and his people, until he left none remaining.","34":"Then Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon. And they laid siege to it and fought against it.","35":"And they captured it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. And he devoted every person in it to destruction that day, as he had done to Lachish.","36":"Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron. And they fought against it","37":"and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king and its towns, and every person in it. He left none remaining, as he had done to Eglon, and devoted it to destruction and every person in it.","38":"Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned back to Debir and fought against it","39":"and he captured it with its king and all its towns. And they struck them with the edge of the sword and devoted to destruction every person in it; he left none remaining. Just as he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king, so he did to Debir and to its king.","40":"So Joshua struck the whole land, the hill country and the Negeb and the lowland and the slopes, and all their kings. He left none remaining, but devoted to destruction all that breathed, just as the LORD God of Israel commanded.","41":"And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, as far as Gibeon.","42":"And Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.","43":"Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal."},"11":{"1":"When Jabin, king of Hazor, heard of this, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,","2":"and to the kings who were in the northern hill country, and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in Naphoth-dor on the west,","3":"to the Canaanites in the east and the west, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.","4":"And they came out with all their troops, a great horde, in number like the sand that is on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots.","5":"And all these kings joined their forces and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom to fight with Israel.","6":"And the LORD said to Joshua, \"Do not be afraid of them, for tomorrow at this time I will give over all of them, slain, to Israel.

They took them all in battle.","20":"For it was the LORD's doing to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, in order that they should be devoted to destruction and should receive no mercy but be destroyed, just as the LORD commanded Moses.","21":"And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel.

Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.","12":"And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD.","13":"He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of the city of palms.","14":"And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.","15":"Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, and the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.","16":"And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes.","17":"And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.","18":"And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute.","19":"But he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, \"I have a secret message for you, O king.\" And he commanded, \"Silence.\" And all his attendants went out from his presence.","20":"And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, \"I have a message from God for you.\" And he arose from his seat.","21":"And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.","22":"And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out.","23":"Then Ehud went out into the porch and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them.","24":"When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, \"Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber.\"","25":"And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.","26":"Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah.","27":"When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader.","28":"And he said to them, \"Follow after me, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand.\" So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over.","29":"And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped.","30":"So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.","31":"After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an oxgoad, and he also saved Israel."},"4":{"1":"And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud died.","2":"And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim.","3":"Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help, for he had 900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.","4":"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time.","5":"She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment.","6":"She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali and said to him, \"Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you, 'Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun.","7":"And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand'?\"","8":"Barak said to her, \"If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go.\"","9":"And she said, \"I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.\" Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.","10":"And Barak called out Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.","11":"Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.","12":"When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,","13":"Sisera called out all his chariots, 900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon.","14":"And Deborah said to Barak, \"Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?\" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him.","15":"And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot.","16":"And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.","17":"But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.","18":"And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, \"Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid.\" So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.","19":"And he said to her, \"Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.\" So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.","20":"And he said to her, \"Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say, 'No.'\"","21":"But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died.","22":"And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, \"Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.\" So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.","23":"So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel.","24":"And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."},"5":{"1":"Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day:","2":"\"That the leaders took the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly, bless the LORD!","3":"\"Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes; to the LORD I will sing; I will make melody to the LORD, the God of Israel.","4":"\"LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth trembled and the heavens dropped, yes, the clouds dropped water.","5":"The mountains quaked before the LORD, even Sinai before the LORD, the God of Israel.","6":"\"In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned, and travelers kept to the byways.","7":"The villagers ceased in Israel; they ceased to be until I arose; I, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel.","8":"When new gods were chosen, then war was in the gates. Was shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?","9":"My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless the LORD.","10":"\"Tell of it, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets and you who walk by the way.","11":"To the sound of musicians at the watering places, there they repeat the righteous triumphs of the LORD, the righteous triumphs of his villagers in Israel.\"Then down to the gates marched the people of the LORD.","12":"\"Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, break out in a song! Arise, Barak, lead away your captives, O son of Abinoam.","13":"Then down marched the remnant of the noble; the people of the LORD marched down for me against the mighty.","14":"From Ephraim their root they marched down into the valley, following you, Benjamin, with your kinsmen; from Machir marched down the commanders, and from Zebulun those who bear the lieutenant's staff;","15":"the princes of Issachar came with Deborah, and Issachar faithful to Barak; into the valley they rushed at his heels. Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.","16":"Why did you sit still among the sheepfolds, to hear the whistling for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.","17":"Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan; and Dan, why did he stay with the ships? Asher sat still at the coast of the sea, staying by his landings.","18":"Zebulun is a people who risked their lives to the death; Naphtali, too, on the heights of the field.","19":"\"The kings came, they fought; then fought the kings of Canaan, at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; they got no spoils of silver.","20":"From heaven the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera.","21":"The torrent Kishon swept them away, the ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. March on, my soul, with might!","22":"\"Then loud beat the horses' hoofs with the galloping, galloping of his steeds.","23":"\"Curse Meroz, says the angel of the LORD, curse its inhabitants thoroughly, because they did not come to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.","24":"\"Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, of tent-dwelling women most blessed.","25":"He asked water and she gave him milk; she brought him curds in a noble's bowl.","26":"She sent her hand to the tent peg and her right hand to the workmen's mallet; she struck Sisera; she crushed his head; she shattered and pierced his temple.","27":"Between her feet he sank, he fell, he lay still; between her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell--dead.","28":"\"Out of the window she peered, the mother of Sisera wailed through the lattice: 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots?'","29":"Her wisest princesses answer, indeed, she answers herself,","30":"'Have they not found and divided the spoil?--A womb or two for every man; spoil of dyed materials for Sisera, spoil of dyed materials embroidered, two pieces of dyed work embroidered for the neck as spoil?'","31":"\"So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But your friends be like the sun as he rises in his might.\"And the land had rest for forty years."},"6":{"1":"The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hand of Midian seven years.","2":"And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.","3":"For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them.","4":"They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey.","5":"For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come like locusts in number--both they and their camels could not be counted--so that they laid waste the land as they came in.","6":"And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel cried out for help to the LORD.","7":"When the people of Israel cried out to the LORD on account of the Midianites,","8":"the LORD sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, \"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage.","9":"And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land.","10":"And I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.' But you have not obeyed my voice.\"","11":"Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites.","12":"And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, \"The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor.\"","13":"And Gideon said to him, \"Please, sir, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.\"","14":"And the LORD turned to him and said, \"Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?\"","15":"And he said to him, \"Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.\"","16":"And the LORD said to him, \"But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.\"","17":"And he said to him, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speaks with me.","18":"Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.\" And he said, \"I will stay till you return.\"","19":"So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them.","20":"And the angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.\" And he did so.","21":"Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.","22":"Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD. And Gideon said, \"Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.\"","23":"But the LORD said to him, \"Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die.\"","24":"Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, The LORD is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.","25":"That night the LORD said to him, \"Take your father's bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it","26":"and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.\"","27":"So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.","28":"When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built.","29":"And they said to one another, \"Who has done this thing?\" And after they had searched and inquired, they said, \"Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.\"","30":"Then the men of the town said to Joash, \"Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.\"","31":"But Joash said to all who stood against him, \"Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down.\"","32":"Therefore on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, \"Let Baal contend against him,\" because he broke down his altar.","33":"Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.","34":"But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him.","35":"And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them.","36":"Then Gideon said to God, \"If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,","37":"behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.\"","38":"And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.","39":"Then Gideon said to God, \"Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew.\"","40":"And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew."},"7":{"1":"Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.","2":"The LORD said to Gideon, \"The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me, saying, 'My own hand has saved me.'","3":"Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, 'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead.'\" Then 22,000 of the people returned, and 10,000 remained.","4":"And the LORD said to Gideon, \"The people are still too many. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there, and anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall go with you,' shall go with you, and anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall not go with you,' shall not go.\"","5":"So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said to Gideon, \"Every one who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself. Likewise, every one who kneels down to drink.\"","6":"And the number of those who lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.","7":"And the LORD said to Gideon, \"With the 300 men who lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hand, and let all the others go every man to his home.\"","8":"So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. And he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the 300 men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.","9":"That same night the LORD said to him, \"Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand.","10":"But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant.","11":"And you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.\" Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp.","12":"And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts in abundance, and their camels were without number, as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance.","13":"When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade. And he said, \"Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.\"","14":"And his comrade answered, \"This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp.\"","15":"As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, \"Arise, for the LORD has given the host of Midian into your hand.\"","16":"And he divided the 300 men into three companies and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars.","17":"And he said to them, \"Look at me, and do likewise. When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.","18":"When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'\"","19":"So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch. And they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.","20":"Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow. And they cried out, \"A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!\"","21":"Every man stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran. They cried out and fled.","22":"When they blew the 300 trumpets, the LORD set every man's sword against his comrade and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.","23":"And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.","24":"Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, \"Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.\" So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.","25":"And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan."},"8":{"1":"Then the men of Ephraim said to him, \"What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight with Midian?\" And they accused him fiercely.","2":"And he said to them, \"What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?","3":"God has given into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you?\" Then their anger against him subsided when he said this.","4":"And Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and the 300 men who were with him, exhausted yet pursuing.","5":"So he said to the men of Succoth, \"Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.\"","6":"And the officials of Succoth said, \"Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?\"","7":"So Gideon said, \"Well then, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.\"","8":"And from there he went up to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.","9":"And he said to the men of Penuel, \"When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.\"","10":"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East, for there had fallen 120,000 men who drew the sword.","11":"And Gideon went up by the way of the tent dwellers east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the army, for the army felt secure.","12":"And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he threw all the army into a panic.","13":"Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.","14":"And he captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men.","15":"And he came to the men of Succoth and said, \"Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted?'\"","16":"And he took the elders of the city, and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth a lesson.","17":"And he broke down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.","18":"Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, \"Where are the men whom you killed at Tabor?\" They answered, \"As you are, so were they. Every one of them resembled the son of a king.\"","19":"And he said, \"They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.\"","20":"So he said to Jether his firstborn, \"Rise and kill them!\" But the young man did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a young man.","21":"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, \"Rise yourself and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength.\" And Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.","22":"Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, \"Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also, for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.\"","23":"Gideon said to them, \"I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD will rule over you.\"","24":"And Gideon said to them, \"Let me make a request of you: every one of you give me the earrings from his spoil.\" (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)","25":"And they answered, \"We will willingly give them.\" And they spread a cloak, and every man threw in it the earrings of his spoil.","26":"And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels.","27":"And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel whored after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family.","28":"So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they raised their heads no more.

Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands?","12":"Turn back, my daughters; go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons,","13":"would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.\"","14":"Then they lifted up their voices and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.","15":"And she said, \"See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.\"","16":"But Ruth said, \"Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.","17":"Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.\"","18":"And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.","19":"So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them. And the women said, \"Is this Naomi?\"","20":"She said to them, \"Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.","21":"I went away full, and the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi, when the LORD has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?\"","22":"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabite her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest."},"2":{"1":"Now Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz.","2":"And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, \"Let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.\" And she said to her, \"Go, my daughter.\"","3":"So she set out and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers, and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the clan of Elimelech.","4":"And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem. And he said to the reapers, \"The LORD be with you!\" And they answered, \"The LORD bless you.\"","5":"Then Boaz said to his young man who was in charge of the reapers, \"Whose young woman is this?\"","6":"And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, \"She is the young Moabite woman, who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab.","7":"She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers.' So she came, and she has continued from early morning until now, except for a short rest.\"","8":"Then Boaz said to Ruth, \"Now, listen, my daughter, do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but keep close to my young women.","9":"Let your eyes be on the field that they are reaping, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn.\"","10":"Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, \"Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?\"","11":"But Boaz answered her, \"All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before.","12":"The LORD repay you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!\"","13":"Then she said, \"I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not one of your servants.\"","14":"And at mealtime Boaz said to her, \"Come here and eat some bread and dip your morsel in the wine.\" So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her roasted grain. And she ate until she was satisfied, and she had some left over.","15":"When she rose to glean, Boaz instructed his young men, saying, \"Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.","16":"And also pull out some from the bundles for her and leave it for her to glean, and do not rebuke her.\"","17":"So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.","18":"And she took it up and went into the city. Her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her what food she had left over after being satisfied.","19":"And her mother-in-law said to her, \"Where did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.\" So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, \"The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.\"","20":"And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, \"May he be blessed by the LORD, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!\" Naomi also said to her, \"The man is a close relative of ours, one of our redeemers.\"","21":"And Ruth the Moabite said, \"Besides, he said to me, 'You shall keep close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.'\"","22":"And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, \"It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, lest in another field you be assaulted.\"","23":"So she kept close to the young women of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests. And she lived with her mother-in-law."},"3":{"1":"Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, \"My daughter, should I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?","2":"Is not Boaz our relative, with whose young women you were? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.","3":"Wash therefore and anoint yourself, and put on your cloak and go down to the threshing floor, but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.","4":"But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down, and he will tell you what to do.\"","5":"And she replied, \"All that you say I will do.\"","6":"So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her.","7":"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down.","8":"At midnight the man was startled and turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet!","9":"He said, \"Who are you?\" And she answered, \"I am Ruth, your servant. Spread your wings over your servant, for you are a redeemer.\"","10":"And he said, \"May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have made this last kindness greater than the first in that you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich.","11":"And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you ask, for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a worthy woman.","12":"And now it is true that I am a redeemer. Yet there is a redeemer nearer than I.","13":"Remain tonight, and in the morning, if he will redeem you, good; let him do it. But if he is not willing to redeem you, then, as the LORD lives, I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning.\"","14":"So she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before one could recognize another. And he said, \"Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.\"","15":"And he said, \"Bring the garment you are wearing and hold it out.\" So she held it, and he measured out six measures of barley and put it on her. Then she went into the city.","16":"And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, \"How did you fare, my daughter?\" Then she told her all that the man had done for her,","17":"saying, \"These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said to me, 'You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law.'\"","18":"She replied, \"Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest but will settle the matter today.\""},"4":{"1":"Now Boaz had gone up to the gate and sat down there. And behold, the redeemer, of whom Boaz had spoken, came by. So Boaz said, \"Turn aside, friend; sit down here.\" And he turned aside and sat down.","2":"And he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, \"Sit down here.\" So they sat down.","3":"Then he said to the redeemer, \"Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.","4":"So I thought I would tell you of it and say, 'Buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people.' If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not, tell me, that I may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come after you.\" And he said, \"I will redeem it.\"","5":"Then Boaz said, \"The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the widow of the dead, in order to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance.\"","6":"Then the redeemer said, \"I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I cannot redeem it.\"","7":"Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of attesting in Israel.","8":"So when the redeemer said to Boaz, \"Buy it for yourself,\" he drew off his sandal.","9":"Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people, \"You are witnesses this day that I have bought from the hand of Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech and all that belonged to Chilion and to Mahlon.","10":"Also Ruth the Moabite, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his native place. You are witnesses this day.\"","11":"Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, \"We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman, who is coming into your house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you act worthily in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem,","12":"and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring that the LORD will give you by this young woman.\"","13":"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.","14":"Then the women said to Naomi, \"Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a redeemer, and may his name be renowned in Israel!","15":"He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.\"","16":"Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse.","17":"And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, \"A son has been born to Naomi.\" They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.","18":"Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,","19":"Hezron fathered Ram, Ram fathered Amminadab,","20":"Amminadab fathered Nahshon, Nahshon fathered Salmon,","21":"Salmon fathered Boaz, Boaz fathered Obed,","22":"Obed fathered Jesse, and Jesse fathered David."}},"1 Samuel":{"1":{"1":"There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.","2":"He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.","3":"Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD.","4":"On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.","5":"But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb.","6":"And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.","7":"So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.","8":"And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, \"Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?\"","9":"After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.","10":"She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly.","11":"And she vowed a vow and said, \"O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.\"","12":"As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.","13":"Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.","14":"And Eli said to her, \"How long will you go on being drunk? Put away your wine from you.\"","15":"But Hannah answered, \"No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.","16":"Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.\"","17":"Then Eli answered, \"Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.\"","18":"And she said, \"Let your servant find favor in your eyes.\" Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.","19":"They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.","20":"And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, \"I have asked for him from the LORD.\"","21":"The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow.","22":"But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, \"As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the LORD and dwell there forever.\"","23":"Elkanah her husband said to her, \"Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the LORD establish his word.\" So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.","24":"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. And the child was young.","25":"Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.","26":"And she said, \"Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD.","27":"For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him.","28":"Therefore I have lent him to the LORD. As long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD.\"And he worshiped the LORD there."},"2":{"1":"And Hannah prayed and said, \"My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in the LORD. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.","2":"\"There is none holy like the LORD; there is none besides you; there is no rock like our God.","3":"Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.","4":"The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble bind on strength.","5":"Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.","6":"The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.","7":"The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts.","8":"He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and on them he has set the world.","9":"\"He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness, for not by might shall a man prevail.","10":"The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them he will thunder in heaven. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king and exalt the power of his anointed.\"","11":"Then Elkanah went home to Ramah. And the boy ministered to the LORD in the presence of Eli the priest.","12":"Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know the LORD.","13":"The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,","14":"and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.","15":"Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, \"Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw.\"","16":"And if the man said to him, \"Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,\" he would say, \"No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.\"","17":"Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.","18":"Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy clothed with a linen ephod.","19":"And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.","20":"Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, \"May the LORD give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the LORD.\" So then they would return to their home.","21":"Indeed the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the young man Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD.","22":"Now Eli was very old, and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting.","23":"And he said to them, \"Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people.","24":"No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad.","25":"If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?\" But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the will of the LORD to put them to death.","26":"Now the young man Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and also with man.","27":"And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, \"Thus the LORD has said, 'Did I indeed reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh?","28":"Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel.","29":"Why then do you scorn my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?'","30":"Therefore the LORD the God of Israel declares: 'I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,' but now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.","31":"Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your house.","32":"Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed on Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.","33":"The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart, and all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men.","34":"And this that shall come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day.","35":"And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed forever.","36":"And everyone who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and shall say, \"Please put me in one of the priests' places, that I may eat a morsel of bread.\"'\""},"3":{"1":"Now the young man Samuel was ministering to the LORD under Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.","2":"At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place.","3":"The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.","4":"Then the LORD called Samuel, and he said, \"Here I am!\"","5":"and ran to Eli and said, \"Here I am, for you called me.\" But he said, \"I did not call; lie down again.\" So he went and lay down.","6":"And the LORD called again, \"Samuel!\" and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, \"Here I am, for you called me.\" But he said, \"I did not call, my son; lie down again.\"","7":"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.","8":"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, \"Here I am, for you called me.\" Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the young man.","9":"Therefore Eli said to Samuel, \"Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant hears.'\" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.","10":"And the LORD came and stood, calling as at other times, \"Samuel! Samuel!\" And Samuel said, \"Speak, for your servant hears.\"","11":"Then the LORD said to Samuel, \"Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.","12":"On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.","13":"And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.","14":"Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.\"","15":"Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.","16":"But Eli called Samuel and said, \"Samuel, my son.\" And he said, \"Here I am.\"","17":"And Eli said, \"What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.\"","18":"So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, \"It is the LORD. Let him do what seems good to him.\"","19":"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.","20":"And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD.","21":"And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD."},"4":{"1":"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines. They encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.","2":"The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle.","3":"And when the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, \"Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.\"","4":"So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.","5":"As soon as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.","6":"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, \"What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?\" And when they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp,","7":"the Philistines were afraid, for they said, \"A god has come into the camp.\" And they said, \"Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.","8":"Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.","9":"Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight.\"","10":"So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home. And there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.","11":"And the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.","12":"A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head.","13":"When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out.","14":"When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, \"What is this uproar?\" Then the man hurried and came and told Eli.","15":"Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set so that he could not see.","16":"And the man said to Eli, \"I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.\" And he said, \"How did it go, my son?\"","17":"He who brought the news answered and said, \"Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great defeat among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.\"","18":"As soon as he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.","19":"Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth, for her pains came upon her.","20":"And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, \"Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son.\" But she did not answer or pay attention.","21":"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, \"The glory has departed from Israel!\" because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.","22":"And she said, \"The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.\""},"5":{"1":"When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.","2":"Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it up beside Dagon.","3":"And when the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.","4":"But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.","5":"This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.","6":"The hand of the LORD was heavy against the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and afflicted them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory.","7":"And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, \"The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god.\"","8":"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, \"What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?\" They answered, \"Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.\" So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there.","9":"But after they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very great panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them.","10":"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.

The hand of God was very heavy there.","12":"The men who did not die were struck with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven."},"6":{"1":"The ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.","2":"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, \"What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place.\"","3":"They said, \"If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand does not turn away from you.\"","4":"And they said, \"What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?\" They answered, \"Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords.","5":"So you must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you and your gods and your land.","6":"Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had dealt severely with them, did they not send the people away, and they departed?","7":"Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milk cows on which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them.","8":"And take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart and put in a box at its side the figures of gold, which you are returning to him as a guilt offering. Then send it off and let it go its way","9":"and watch. If it goes up on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence.\"","10":"The men did so, and took two milk cows and yoked them to the cart and shut up their calves at home.","11":"And they put the ark of the LORD on the cart and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors.","12":"And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh along one highway, lowing as they went. They turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.","13":"Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it.","14":"The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. A great stone was there. And they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.","15":"And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was beside it, in which were the golden figures, and set them upon the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to the LORD.","16":"And when the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.","17":"These are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron,","18":"and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and unwalled villages. The great stone beside which they set down the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.","19":"And he struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked upon the ark of the LORD. He struck seventy men of them, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great blow.","20":"Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, \"Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up away from us?\"","21":"So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, \"The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you.\""},"7":{"1":"And the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD and brought it to the house of Abinadab on the hill. And they consecrated his son Eleazar to have charge of the ark of the LORD.","2":"From the day that the ark was lodged at Kiriath-jearim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.","3":"And Samuel said to all the house of Israel, \"If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you and direct your heart to the LORD and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.\"","4":"So the people of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and they served the LORD only.","5":"Then Samuel said, \"Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you.\"","6":"So they gathered at Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before the LORD and fasted on that day and said there, \"We have sinned against the LORD.\" And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.","7":"Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines.","8":"And the people of Israel said to Samuel, \"Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines.\"","9":"So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. And Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.","10":"As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel. But the LORD thundered with a mighty sound that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion, and they were routed before Israel.","11":"And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and struck them, as far as below Beth-car.","12":"Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen and called its name Ebenezer; for he said, \"Till now the LORD has helped us.\"","13":"So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.","14":"The cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.","15":"Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.","16":"And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. And he judged Israel in all these places.","17":"Then he would return to Ramah, for his home was there, and there also he judged Israel. And he built there an altar to the LORD."},"8":{"1":"When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel.","2":"The name of his firstborn son was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba.","3":"Yet his sons did not walk in his ways but turned aside after gain. They took bribes and perverted justice.","4":"Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah","5":"and said to him, \"Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations.\"","6":"But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, \"Give us a king to judge us.\" And Samuel prayed to the LORD.","7":"And the LORD said to Samuel, \"Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.","8":"According to all the deeds that they have done, from the day I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are also doing to you.","9":"Now then, obey their voice; only you shall solemnly warn them and show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them.\"","10":"So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking for a king from him.","11":"He said, \"These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots.","12":"And he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.","13":"He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.","14":"He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants.","15":"He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.","16":"He will take your male servants and female servants and the best of your young men and your donkeys, and put them to his work.","17":"He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.","18":"And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you in that day.\"","19":"But the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel. And they said, \"No! But there shall be a king over us,","20":"that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.\"","21":"And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.","22":"And the LORD said to Samuel, \"Obey their voice and make them a king.\" Samuel then said to the men of Israel, \"Go every man to his city.\""},"9":{"1":"There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth.","2":"And he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.","3":"Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, \"Take one of the young men with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.\"","4":"And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, but did not find them.","5":"When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, \"Come, let us go back, lest my father cease to care about the donkeys and become anxious about us.\"","6":"But he said to him, \"Behold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes true. So now let us go there. Perhaps he can tell us the way we should go.\"","7":"Then Saul said to his servant, \"But if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?\"","8":"The servant answered Saul again, \"Here, I have with me a quarter of a shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God to tell us our way.\"","9":"(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, \"Come, let us go to the seer,\" for today's \"prophet\" was formerly called a seer.)","10":"And Saul said to his servant, \"Well said; come, let us go.\" So they went to the city where the man of God was.","11":"As they went up the hill to the city, they met young women coming out to draw water and said to them, \"Is the seer here?\"","12":"They answered, \"He is; behold, he is just ahead of you. Hurry. He has come just now to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.","13":"As soon as you enter the city you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat till he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately.\"","14":"So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.","15":"Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed to Samuel:","16":"\"Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He shall save my people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have seen my people, because their cry has come to me.\"","17":"When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, \"Here is the man of whom I spoke to you! He it is who shall restrain my people.\"","18":"Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate and said, \"Tell me where is the house of the seer?\"","19":"Samuel answered Saul, \"I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind.","20":"As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father's house?\"","21":"Saul answered, \"Am I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my clan the humblest of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?\"","22":"Then Samuel took Saul and his young man and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, who were about thirty persons.","23":"And Samuel said to the cook, \"Bring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, 'Put it aside.'\"","24":"So the cook took up the leg and what was on it and set them before Saul. And Samuel said, \"See, what was kept is set before you. Eat, because it was kept for you until the hour appointed, that you might eat with the guests.\" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.","25":"And when they came down from the high place into the city, a bed was spread for Saul on the roof, and he lay down to sleep.","26":"Then at the break of dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, \"Up, that I may send you on your way.\" So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.","27":"As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, \"Tell the servant to pass on before us, and when he has passed on, stop here yourself for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God.\""},"10":{"1":"Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head and kissed him and said, \"Has not the LORD anointed you to be prince over his people Israel? And you shall reign over the people of the LORD and you will save them from the hand of their surrounding enemies. And this shall be the sign to you that the LORD has anointed you to be prince over his heritage.","2":"When you depart from me today, you will meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, 'The donkeys that you went to seek are found, and now your father has ceased to care about the donkeys and is anxious about you, saying, \"What shall I do about my son?\"'","3":"Then you shall go on from there further and come to the oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.","4":"And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand.","5":"After that you shall come to Gibeath-elohim, where there is a garrison of the Philistines. And there, as soon as you come to the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, prophesying.","6":"Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man.","7":"Now when these signs meet you, do what your hand finds to do, for God is with you.","8":"Then go down before me to Gilgal. And behold, I am coming to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do.\"","9":"When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart. And all these signs came to pass that day.","10":"When they came to Gibeah, behold, a group of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them.","11":"And when all who knew him previously saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, \"What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?\"","12":"And a man of the place answered, \"And who is their father?\" Therefore it became a proverb, \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\"","13":"When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.","14":"Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, \"Where did you go?\" And he said, \"To seek the donkeys. And when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.\"","15":"And Saul's uncle said, \"Please tell me what Samuel said to you.\"","16":"And Saul said to his uncle, \"He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.\" But about the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.","17":"Now Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah.","18":"And he said to the people of Israel, \"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.'","19":"But today you have rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses, and you have said to him, 'Set a king over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your thousands.\"","20":"Then Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.","21":"He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its clans, and the clan of the Matrites was taken by lot; and Saul the son of Kish was taken by lot. But when they sought him, he could not be found.","22":"So they inquired again of the LORD, \"Is there a man still to come?\" and the LORD said, \"Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.\"","23":"Then they ran and took him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.","24":"And Samuel said to all the people, \"Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? There is none like him among all the people.\" And all the people shouted, \"Long live the king!\"","25":"Then Samuel told the people the rights and duties of the kingship, and he wrote them in a book and laid it up before the LORD. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his home.","26":"Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched.","27":"But some worthless fellows said, \"How can this man save us?\" And they despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace."},"11":{"1":"Then Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead, and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, \"Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.\"","2":"But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, \"On this condition I will make a treaty with you, that I gouge out all your right eyes, and thus bring disgrace on all Israel.\"","3":"The elders of Jabesh said to him, \"Give us seven days respite that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will give ourselves up to you.\"","4":"When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, they reported the matter in the ears of the people, and all the people wept aloud.","5":"Now, behold, Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen. And Saul said, \"What is wrong with the people, that they are weeping?\" So they told him the news of the men of Jabesh.","6":"And the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled.","7":"He took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, \"Whoever does not come out after Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen!\" Then the dread of the LORD fell upon the people, and they came out as one man.","8":"When he mustered them at Bezek, the people of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.","9":"And they said to the messengers who had come, \"Thus shall you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.'\" When the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, they were glad.","10":"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, \"Tomorrow we will give ourselves up to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.\"","11":"And the next day Saul put the people in three companies. And they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.","12":"Then the people said to Samuel, \"Who is it that said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring the men, that we may put them to death.\"","13":"But Saul said, \"Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has worked salvation in Israel.\"","14":"Then Samuel said to the people, \"Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingdom.\"","15":"So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly."},"12":{"1":"And Samuel said to all Israel, \"Behold, I have obeyed your voice in all that you have said to me and have made a king over you.","2":"And now, behold, the king walks before you, and I am old and gray; and behold, my sons are with you.

But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, that we may serve you.'","11":"And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in safety.","12":"And when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us,' when the LORD your God was your king.","13":"And now behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; behold, the LORD has set a king over you.","14":"If you will fear the LORD and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God, it will be well.","15":"But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you and your king.","16":"Now therefore stand still and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes.","17":"Is it not wheat harvest today?

So Saul said to the priest, \"Withdraw your hand.\"","20":"Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, every Philistine's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.","21":"Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.","22":"Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle.","23":"So the LORD saved Israel that day. And the battle passed beyond Beth-aven.","24":"And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day, so Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, \"Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.\" So none of the people had tasted food.","25":"Now when all the people came to the forest, behold, there was honey on the ground.","26":"And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.","27":"But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath, so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright.","28":"Then one of the people said, \"Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food this day.'\" And the people were faint.","29":"Then Jonathan said, \"My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey.","30":"How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found. For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great.\"","31":"They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint.","32":"The people pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood.","33":"Then they told Saul, \"Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood.\" And he said, \"You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.\"","34":"And Saul said, \"Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, 'Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'\" So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there.","35":"And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.","36":"Then Saul said, \"Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.\" And they said, \"Do whatever seems good to you.\" But the priest said, \"Let us draw near to God here.\"","37":"And Saul inquired of God, \"Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?\" But he did not answer him that day.","38":"And Saul said, \"Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today.","39":"For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.\" But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.","40":"Then he said to all Israel, \"You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.\" And the people said to Saul, \"Do what seems good to you.\"","41":"Therefore Saul said, \"O LORD God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim. But if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.\" And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.","42":"Then Saul said, \"Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.\" And Jonathan was taken.","43":"Then Saul said to Jonathan, \"Tell me what you have done.\" And Jonathan told him, \"I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die.\"","44":"And Saul said, \"God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan.\"","45":"Then the people said to Saul, \"Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.\" So the people ransomed Jonathan, so that he did not die.","46":"Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.","47":"When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned he routed them.","48":"And he did valiantly and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.","49":"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.","50":"And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.","51":"Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.","52":"There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself."},"15":{"1":"And Samuel said to Saul, \"The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore listen to the words of the LORD.","2":"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I have noted what Amalek did to Israel in opposing them on the way when they came up out of Egypt.","3":"Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'\"","4":"So Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah.","5":"And Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.","6":"Then Saul said to the Kenites, \"Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.\" So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.","7":"And Saul defeated the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.","8":"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive and devoted to destruction all the people with the edge of the sword.","9":"But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fattened calves and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them. All that was despised and worthless they devoted to destruction.","10":"The word of the LORD came to Samuel:","11":"\"I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments.\" And Samuel was angry, and he cried to the LORD all night.","12":"And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, \"Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself and turned and passed on and went down to Gilgal.\"","13":"And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, \"Blessed be you to the LORD. I have performed the commandment of the LORD.\"","14":"And Samuel said, \"What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?\"","15":"Saul said, \"They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God, and the rest we have devoted to destruction.\"","16":"Then Samuel said to Saul, \"Stop! I will tell you what the LORD said to me this night.\" And he said to him, \"Speak.\"","17":"And Samuel said, \"Though you are little in your own eyes, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.","18":"And the LORD sent you on a mission and said, 'Go, devote to destruction the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.'","19":"Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you pounce on the spoil and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD?\"","20":"And Saul said to Samuel, \"I have obeyed the voice of the LORD. I have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me. I have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I have devoted the Amalekites to destruction.","21":"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.\"","22":"And Samuel said, \"Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.","23":"For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.\"","24":"Saul said to Samuel, \"I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.","25":"Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me that I may worship the LORD.\"","26":"And Samuel said to Saul, \"I will not return with you. For you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.\"","27":"As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, and it tore.","28":"And Samuel said to him, \"The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.","29":"And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or have regret, for he is not a man, that he should have regret.\"","30":"Then he said, \"I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may bow before the LORD your God.\"","31":"So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed before the LORD.","32":"Then Samuel said, \"Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.\" And Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, \"Surely the bitterness of death is past.\"","33":"And Samuel said, \"As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.\" And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.","34":"Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.","35":"And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel."},"16":{"1":"The LORD said to Samuel, \"How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.\"","2":"And Samuel said, \"How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.\" And the LORD said, \"Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'","3":"And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. And you shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you.\"","4":"Samuel did what the LORD commanded and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling and said, \"Do you come peaceably?\"","5":"And he said, \"Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.\" And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.","6":"When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, \"Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.\"","7":"But the LORD said to Samuel, \"Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.\"","8":"Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, \"Neither has the LORD chosen this one.\"","9":"Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, \"Neither has the LORD chosen this one.\"","10":"And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, \"The LORD has not chosen these.\"","11":"Then Samuel said to Jesse, \"Are all your sons here?\" And he said, \"There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep.\" And Samuel said to Jesse, \"Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here.\"","12":"And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the LORD said, \"Arise, anoint him, for this is he.\"","13":"Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.","14":"Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD tormented him.","15":"And Saul's servants said to him, \"Behold now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.","16":"Let our lord now command your servants who are before you to seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre, and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well.\"","17":"So Saul said to his servants, \"Provide for me a man who can play well and bring him to me.\"","18":"One of the young men answered, \"Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence, and the LORD is with him.\"","19":"Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, \"Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.\"","20":"And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread and a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them by David his son to Saul.","21":"And David came to Saul and entered his service. And Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.","22":"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, \"Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor in my sight.\"","23":"And whenever the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the lyre and played it with his hand. So Saul was refreshed and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."},"17":{"1":"Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle. And they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.","2":"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines.","3":"And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.","4":"And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.","5":"He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.","6":"And he had bronze armor on his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders.","7":"The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him.","8":"He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, \"Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.","9":"If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.\"","10":"And the Philistine said, \"I defy the ranks of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together.\"","11":"When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.","12":"Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years.","13":"The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.","14":"David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul,","15":"but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.","16":"For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.","17":"And Jesse said to David his son, \"Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.","18":"Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See if your brothers are well, and bring some token from them.\"","19":"Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.","20":"And David rose early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the encampment as the host was going out to the battle line, shouting the war cry.","21":"And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army.","22":"And David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the ranks and went and greeted his brothers.","23":"As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before. And David heard him.","24":"All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were much afraid.","25":"And the men of Israel said, \"Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in Israel.\"","26":"And David said to the men who stood by him, \"What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?\"","27":"And the people answered him in the same way, \"So shall it be done to the man who kills him.\"","28":"Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, \"Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.\"","29":"And David said, \"What have I done now? Was it not but a word?\"","30":"And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way, and the people answered him again as before.","31":"When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him.","32":"And David said to Saul, \"Let no man's heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\"","33":"And Saul said to David, \"You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.\"","34":"But David said to Saul, \"Your servant used to keep sheep for his father. And when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock,","35":"I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth. And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him.","36":"Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.\"","37":"And David said, \"The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" And Saul said to David, \"Go, and the LORD be with you!\"","38":"Then Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail,","39":"and David strapped his sword over his armor. And he tried in vain to go, for he had not tested them. Then David said to Saul, \"I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them.\" So David put them off.","40":"Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd's pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.","41":"And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him.","42":"And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance.","43":"And the Philistine said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.","44":"The Philistine said to David, \"Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field.\"","45":"Then David said to the Philistine, \"You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.","46":"This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,","47":"and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hand.\"","48":"When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.","49":"And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.","50":"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David.","51":"Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.","52":"And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron.","53":"And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.","54":"And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.","55":"As soon as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is this youth?\" And Abner said, \"As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.\"","56":"And the king said, \"Inquire whose son the boy is.\"","57":"And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.","58":"And Saul said to him, \"Whose son are you, young man?\" And David answered, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\""},"18":{"1":"As soon as he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.","2":"And Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father's house.","3":"Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.","4":"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his belt.","5":"And David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him, so that Saul set him over the men of war. And this was good in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.","6":"As they were coming home, when David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments.","7":"And the women sang to one another as they celebrated, \"Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands.\"","8":"And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him. He said, \"They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?\"","9":"And Saul eyed David from that day on.","10":"The next day a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand.","11":"And Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, \"I will pin David to the wall.\" But David evaded him twice.","12":"Saul was afraid of David because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.","13":"So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand. And he went out and came in before the people.","14":"And David had success in all his undertakings, for the LORD was with him.","15":"And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in fearful awe of him.","16":"But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.","17":"Then Saul said to David, \"Here is my elder daughter Merab. I will give her to you for a wife. Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD's battles.\" For Saul thought, \"Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.\"","18":"And David said to Saul, \"Who am I, and who are my relatives, my father's clan in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?\"","19":"But at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.","20":"Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.","21":"Saul thought, \"Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.\" Therefore Saul said to David a second time, \"You shall now be my son-in-law.\"","22":"And Saul commanded his servants, \"Speak to David in private and say, 'Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now then become the king's son-in-law.'\"","23":"And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, \"Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man and have no reputation?\"","24":"And the servants of Saul told him, \"Thus and so did David speak.\"","25":"Then Saul said, \"Thus shall you say to David, 'The king desires no bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king's enemies.'\" Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.","26":"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. Before the time had expired,","27":"David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife.","28":"But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him,","29":"Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David's enemy continually.","30":"Then the princes of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed."},"19":{"1":"And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David.","2":"And Jonathan told David, \"Saul my father seeks to kill you. Therefore be on your guard in the morning. Stay in a secret place and hide yourself.","3":"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you. And if I learn anything I will tell you.\"","4":"And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, \"Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have brought good to you.","5":"For he took his life in his hand and he struck down the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?\"","6":"And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan. Saul swore, \"As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death.\"","7":"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan reported to him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.","8":"And there was war again. And David went out and fought with the Philistines and struck them with a great blow, so that they fled before him.","9":"Then a harmful spirit from the LORD came upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing the lyre.","10":"And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.","11":"Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, \"If you do not escape with your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.\"","12":"So Michal let David down through the window, and he fled away and escaped.","13":"Michal took an image and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goats' hair at its head and covered it with the clothes.","14":"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, \"He is sick.\"","15":"Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, \"Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.\"","16":"And when the messengers came in, behold, the image was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at its head.","17":"Saul said to Michal, \"Why have you deceived me thus and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?\" And Michal answered Saul, \"He said to me, 'Let me go. Why should I kill you?'\"","18":"Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and lived at Naioth.","19":"And it was told Saul, \"Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.\"","20":"Then Saul sent messengers to take David, and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.","21":"When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.","22":"Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked, \"Where are Samuel and David?\" And one said, \"Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.\"","23":"And he went there to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.","24":"And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night. Thus it is said, \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\""},"20":{"1":"Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, \"What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?\"","2":"And he said to him, \"Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me. And why should my father hide this from me? It is not so.\"","3":"But David vowed again, saying, \"Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he thinks, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.' But truly, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.\"","4":"Then Jonathan said to David, \"Whatever you say, I will do for you.\"","5":"David said to Jonathan, \"Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening.","6":"If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the clan.'","7":"If he says, 'Good!' it will be well with your servant, but if he is angry, then know that harm is determined by him.","8":"Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?\"","9":"And Jonathan said, \"Far be it from you! If I knew that it was determined by my father that harm should come to you, would I not tell you?\"","10":"Then David said to Jonathan, \"Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?\"","11":"And Jonathan said to David, \"Come, let us go out into the field.\" So they both went out into the field.","12":"And Jonathan said to David, \"The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! When I have sounded out my father, about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you?","13":"But should it please my father to do you harm, the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also if I do not disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. May the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.","14":"If I am still alive, show me the steadfast love of the LORD, that I may not die;","15":"and do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever, when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.\"","16":"And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, \"May the LORD take vengeance on David's enemies.\"","17":"And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.","18":"Then Jonathan said to him, \"Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.","19":"On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand, and remain beside the stone heap.","20":"And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.","21":"And behold, I will send the young man, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to the young man, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,' then you are to come, for, as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger.","22":"But if I say to the youth, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then go, for the LORD has sent you away.","23":"And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever.\"","24":"So David hid himself in the field. And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.","25":"The king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.","26":"Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, \"Something has happened to him. He is not clean; surely he is not clean.\"","27":"But on the second day, the day after the new moon, David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, \"Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?\"","28":"Jonathan answered Saul, \"David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.","29":"He said, 'Let me go, for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away and see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table.\"","30":"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, \"You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?","31":"For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.\"","32":"Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, \"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?\"","33":"But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.","34":"And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.","35":"In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and with him a little boy.","36":"And he said to his boy, \"Run and find the arrows that I shoot.\" As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.","37":"And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, \"Is not the arrow beyond you?\"","38":"And Jonathan called after the boy, \"Hurry! Be quick! Do not stay!\" So Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master.","39":"But the boy knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter.","40":"And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, \"Go and carry them to the city.\"","41":"And as soon as the boy had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed one another and wept with one another, David weeping the most.","42":"Then Jonathan said to David, \"Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.'\" And he rose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city."},"21":{"1":"Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech came to meet David trembling and said to him, \"Why are you alone, and no one with you?\"","2":"And David said to Ahimelech the priest, \"The king has charged me with a matter and said to me, 'Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.' I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.","3":"Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.\"","4":"And the priest answered David, \"I have no common bread on hand, but there is holy bread--if the young men have kept themselves from women.\"","5":"And David answered the priest, \"Truly women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition. The vessels of the young men are holy even when it is an ordinary journey. How much more today will their vessels be holy?\"","6":"So the priest gave him the holy bread, for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the LORD, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.","7":"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD. His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.","8":"Then David said to Ahimelech, \"Then have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.\"","9":"And the priest said, \"The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here.\" And David said, \"There is none like that; give it to me.\"","10":"And David rose and fled that day from Saul and went to Achish the king of Gath.","11":"And the servants of Achish said to him, \"Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances, 'Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?\"","12":"And David took these words to heart and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.","13":"So he changed his behavior before them and pretended to be insane in their hands and made marks on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard.","14":"Then Achish said to his servants, \"Behold, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?","15":"Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?\""},"22":{"1":"David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.","2":"And everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was bitter in soul, gathered to him. And he became captain over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.","3":"And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said to the king of Moab, \"Please let my father and my mother stay with you, till I know what God will do for me.\"","4":"And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.","5":"Then the prophet Gad said to David, \"Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.\" So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.","6":"Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.","7":"And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, \"Hear now, people of Benjamin; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,","8":"that all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day.\"","9":"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saul, \"I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub,","10":"and he inquired of the LORD for him and gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.\"","11":"Then the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were at Nob, and all of them came to the king.","12":"And Saul said, \"Hear now, son of Ahitub.\" And he answered, \"Here I am, my lord.\"","13":"And Saul said to him, \"Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?\"","14":"Then Ahimelech answered the king, \"And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and captain over your bodyguard, and honored in your house?","15":"Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little.\"","16":"And the king said, \"You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house.\"","17":"And the king said to the guard who stood about him, \"Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because their hand also is with David, and they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me.\" But the servants of the king would not put out their hand to strike the priests of the LORD.","18":"Then the king said to Doeg, \"You turn and strike the priests.\" And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.","19":"And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both man and woman, child and infant, ox, donkey and sheep, he put to the sword.","20":"But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.","21":"And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.","22":"And David said to Abiathar, \"I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house.","23":"Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life. With me you shall be in safekeeping.\""},"23":{"1":"Now they told David, \"Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors.\"","2":"Therefore David inquired of the LORD, \"Shall I go and attack these Philistines?\" And the LORD said to David, \"Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.\"","3":"But David's men said to him, \"Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?\"","4":"Then David inquired of the LORD again. And the LORD answered him, \"Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will give the Philistines into your hand.\"","5":"And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their livestock and struck them with a great blow. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.","6":"When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech had fled to David to Keilah, he had come down with an ephod in his hand.","7":"Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, \"God has given him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.\"","8":"And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.","9":"David knew that Saul was plotting harm against him. And he said to Abiathar the priest, \"Bring the ephod here.\"","10":"Then said David, \"O LORD, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account.","11":"Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, the God of Israel, please tell your servant.\" And the LORD said, \"He will come down.\"","12":"Then David said, \"Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?\" And the LORD said, \"They will surrender you.\"","13":"Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the expedition.","14":"And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.","15":"David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.","16":"And Jonathan, Saul's son, rose and went to David at Horesh, and strengthened his hand in God.","17":"And he said to him, \"Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Saul my father also knows this.\"","18":"And the two of them made a covenant before the LORD. David remained at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.","19":"Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, \"Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon?","20":"Now come down, O king, according to all your heart's desire to come down, and our part shall be to surrender him into the king's hand.\"","21":"And Saul said, \"May you be blessed by the LORD, for you have had compassion on me.","22":"Go, make yet more sure. Know and see the place where his foot is, and who has seen him there, for it is told me that he is very cunning.","23":"See therefore and take note of all the lurking places where he hides, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with you. And if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.\"","24":"And they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul.Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.","25":"And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told, so he went down to the rock and lived in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.","26":"Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David was hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them,","27":"a messenger came to Saul, saying, \"Hurry and come, for the Philistines have made a raid against the land.\"","28":"So Saul returned from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. Therefore that place was called the Rock of Escape.","29":"And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of Engedi."},"24":{"1":"When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, \"Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.\"","2":"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats' Rocks.","3":"And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.","4":"And the men of David said to him, \"Here is the day of which the LORD said to you, 'Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.'\" Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul's robe.","5":"And afterward David's heart struck him, because he had cut off a corner of Saul's robe.","6":"He said to his men, \"The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD's anointed, to put out my hand against him, seeing he is the LORD's anointed.\"","7":"So David persuaded his men with these words and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.","8":"Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, \"My lord the king!\" And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage.","9":"And David said to Saul, \"Why do you listen to the words of men who say, 'Behold, David seeks your harm'?","10":"Behold, this day your eyes have seen how the LORD gave you today into my hand in the cave. And some told me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, 'I will not put out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD's anointed.'","11":"See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt my life to take it.","12":"May the LORD judge between me and you, may the LORD avenge me against you, but my hand shall not be against you.","13":"As the proverb of the ancients says, 'Out of the wicked comes wickedness.' But my hand shall not be against you.","14":"After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog! After a flea!","15":"May the LORD therefore be judge and give sentence between me and you, and see to it and plead my cause and deliver me from your hand.\"","16":"As soon as David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, \"Is this your voice, my son David?\" And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.","17":"He said to David, \"You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil.","18":"And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the LORD put me into your hands.","19":"For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? So may the LORD reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.","20":"And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.","21":"Swear to me therefore by the LORD that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.\"","22":"And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold."},"25":{"1":"Now Samuel died. And all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him in his house at Ramah.","2":"Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Paran. And there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was shearing his sheep in Carmel.","3":"Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. The woman was discerning and beautiful, but the man was harsh and badly behaved; he was a Calebite.","4":"David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.","5":"So David sent ten young men. And David said to the young men, \"Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal and greet him in my name.","6":"And thus you shall greet him: 'Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.","7":"I hear that you have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us, and we did them no harm, and they missed nothing all the time they were in Carmel.","8":"Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a feast day. Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.'\"","9":"When David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David, and then they waited.","10":"And Nabal answered David's servants, \"Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters.","11":"Shall I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it to men who come from I do not know where?\"","12":"So David's young men turned away and came back and told him all this.","13":"And David said to his men, \"Every man strap on his sword!\" And every man of them strapped on his sword. David also strapped on his sword. And about four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.","14":"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, \"Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master, and he railed at them.","15":"Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them.","16":"They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.","17":"Now therefore know this and consider what you should do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such a worthless man that one cannot speak to him.\"","18":"Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.","19":"And she said to her young men, \"Go on before me; behold, I come after you.\" But she did not tell her husband Nabal.","20":"And as she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them.","21":"Now David had said, \"Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good.","22":"God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him.\"","23":"When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell before David on her face and bowed to the ground.","24":"She fell at his feet and said, \"On me alone, my lord, be the guilt. Please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant.","25":"Let not my lord regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.","26":"Now then, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, because the LORD has restrained you from bloodguilt and from saving with your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal.","27":"And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.","28":"Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live.","29":"If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the LORD your God. And the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.","30":"And when the LORD has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you and has appointed you prince over Israel,","31":"my lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause or for my lord taking vengeance himself. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.\"","32":"And David said to Abigail, \"Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!","33":"Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from avenging myself with my own hand!","34":"For as surely as the LORD the God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male.\"","35":"Then David received from her hand what she had brought him. And he said to her, \"Go up in peace to your house. See, I have obeyed your voice, and I have granted your petition.\"","36":"And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk. So she told him nothing at all until the morning light.","37":"In the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.","38":"And about ten days later the LORD struck Nabal, and he died.","39":"When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, \"Blessed be the LORD who has avenged the insult I received at the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from wrongdoing. The LORD has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head.\" Then David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her as his wife.","40":"When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, \"David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife.\"","41":"And she rose and bowed with her face to the ground and said, \"Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.\"","42":"And Abigail hurried and rose and mounted a donkey, and her five young women attended her. She followed the messengers of David and became his wife.","43":"David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and both of them became his wives.","44":"Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim."},"26":{"1":"Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, \"Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is on the east of Jeshimon?\"","2":"So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph with three thousand chosen men of Israel to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.","3":"And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshimon. But David remained in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,","4":"David sent out spies and learned that Saul had come.","5":"Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Saul was lying within the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.","6":"Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab's brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah, \"Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?\" And Abishai said, \"I will go down with you.\"","7":"So David and Abishai went to the army by night. And there lay Saul sleeping within the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the army lay around him.","8":"Then said Abishai to David, \"God has given your enemy into your hand this day. Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice.\"","9":"But David said to Abishai, \"Do not destroy him, for who can put out his hand against the LORD's anointed and be guiltless?\"","10":"And David said, \"As the LORD lives, the LORD will strike him, or his day will come to die, or he will go down into battle and perish.","11":"The LORD forbid that I should put out my hand against the LORD's anointed. But take now the spear that is at his head and the jar of water, and let us go.\"","12":"So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head, and they went away. No man saw it or knew it, nor did any awake, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.","13":"Then David went over to the other side and stood far off on the top of the hill, with a great space between them.","14":"And David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, \"Will you not answer, Abner?\" Then Abner answered, \"Who are you who calls to the king?\"","15":"And David said to Abner, \"Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.","16":"This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is and the jar of water that was at his head.\"","17":"Saul recognized David's voice and said, \"Is this your voice, my son David?\" And David said, \"It is my voice, my lord, O king.\"","18":"And he said, \"Why does my lord pursue after his servant? For what have I done? What evil is on my hands?","19":"Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is the LORD who has stirred you up against me, may he accept an offering, but if it is men, may they be cursed before the LORD, for they have driven me out this day that I should have no share in the heritage of the LORD, saying, 'Go, serve other gods.'","20":"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of the LORD, for the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.\"","21":"Then Saul said, \"I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have acted foolishly, and have made a great mistake.\"","22":"And David answered and said, \"Here is the spear, O king! Let one of the young men come over and take it.","23":"The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness, for the LORD gave you into my hand today, and I would not put out my hand against the LORD's anointed.","24":"Behold, as your life was precious this day in my sight, so may my life be precious in the sight of the LORD, and may he deliver me out of all tribulation.\"","25":"Then Saul said to David, \"Blessed be you, my son David! You will do many things and will succeed in them.\" So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place."},"27":{"1":"Then David said in his heart, \"Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand.\"","2":"So David arose and went over, he and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.","3":"And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel, Nabal's widow.","4":"And when it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer sought him.","5":"Then David said to Achish, \"If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be given me in one of the country towns, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?\"","6":"So that day Achish gave him Ziklag. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.","7":"And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.","8":"Now David and his men went up and made raids against the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as far as Shur, to the land of Egypt.","9":"And David would strike the land and would leave neither man nor woman alive, but would take away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the garments, and come back to Achish.","10":"When Achish asked, \"Where have you made a raid today?\" David would say, \"Against the Negeb of Judah,\" or, \"Against the Negeb of the Jerahmeelites,\" or, \"Against the Negeb of the Kenites.\"","11":"And David would leave neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath, thinking, \"Lest they should tell about us and say, 'So David has done.'\" Such was his custom all the while he lived in the country of the Philistines.","12":"And Achish trusted David, thinking, \"He has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel; therefore he shall always be my servant.\""},"28":{"1":"In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, \"Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army.\"","2":"David said to Achish, \"Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.\" And Achish said to David, \"Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.\"","3":"Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the necromancers out of the land.","4":"The Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem. And Saul gathered all Israel, and they encamped at Gilboa.","5":"When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.","6":"And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.","7":"Then Saul said to his servants, \"Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.\" And his servants said to him, \"Behold, there is a medium at En-dor.\"","8":"So Saul disguised himself and put on other garments and went, he and two men with him.

Why then are you laying a trap for my life to bring about my death?\"","10":"But Saul swore to her by the LORD, \"As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.\"","11":"Then the woman said, \"Whom shall I bring up for you?\" He said, \"Bring up Samuel for me.\"","12":"When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, \"Why have you deceived me? You are Saul.\"","13":"The king said to her, \"Do not be afraid. What do you see?\" And the woman said to Saul, \"I see a god coming up out of the earth.\"","14":"He said to her, \"What is his appearance?\" And she said, \"An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.\" And Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage.","15":"Then Samuel said to Saul, \"Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?\" Saul answered, \"I am in great distress, for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do.\"","16":"And Samuel said, \"Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has turned from you and become your enemy?","17":"The LORD has done to you as he spoke by me, for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David.","18":"Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day.","19":"Moreover, the LORD will give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me. The LORD will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.\"","20":"Then Saul fell at once full length on the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.","21":"And the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, \"Behold, your servant has obeyed you. I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to what you have said to me.","22":"Now therefore, you also obey your servant. Let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.\"","23":"He refused and said, \"I will not eat.\" But his servants, together with the woman, urged him, and he listened to their words. So he arose from the earth and sat on the bed.","24":"Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and she took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it,","25":"and she put it before Saul and his servants, and they ate.

And the commanders of the Philistines said to him, \"Send the man back, that he may return to the place to which you have assigned him. He shall not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of the men here?","5":"Is not this David, of whom they sing to one another in dances, 'Saul has struck down his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?\"","6":"Then Achish called David and said to him, \"As the LORD lives, you have been honest, and to me it seems right that you should march out and in with me in the campaign.

Nevertheless, the lords do not approve of you.","7":"So go back now; and go peaceably, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.\"","8":"And David said to Achish, \"But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?\"","9":"And Achish answered David and said, \"I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God. Nevertheless, the commanders of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'","10":"Now then rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you, and start early in the morning, and depart as soon as you have light.\"","11":"So David set out with his men early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines.

They killed no one, but carried them off and went their way.","3":"And when David and his men came to the city, they found it burned with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.","4":"Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weep.","5":"David's two wives also had been taken captive, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.","6":"And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul, each for his sons and daughters.

And Jonadab was a very crafty man.","4":"And he said to him, \"O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?\" Amnon said to him, \"I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.\"","5":"Jonadab said to him, \"Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.'\"","6":"So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, \"Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.\"","7":"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, \"Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him.\"","8":"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.","9":"And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, \"Send out everyone from me.\" So everyone went out from him.","10":"Then Amnon said to Tamar, \"Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand.\" And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.","11":"But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, \"Come, lie with me, my sister.\"","12":"She answered him, \"No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this outrageous thing.","13":"As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the outrageous fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king, for he will not withhold me from you.\"","14":"But he would not listen to her, and being stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.","15":"Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, \"Get up! Go!\"","16":"But she said to him, \"No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me.\" But he would not listen to her.","17":"He called the young man who served him and said, \"Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her.\"","18":"Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her.","19":"And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore. And she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.","20":"And her brother Absalom said to her, \"Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this to heart.\" So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house.","21":"When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.","22":"But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.","23":"After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons.","24":"And Absalom came to the king and said, \"Behold, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.\"","25":"But the king said to Absalom, \"No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.\" He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing.","26":"Then Absalom said, \"If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.\" And the king said to him, \"Why should he go with you?\"","27":"But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.","28":"Then Absalom commanded his servants, \"Mark when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Do not fear; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.\"","29":"So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.","30":"While they were on the way, news came to David, \"Absalom has struck down all the king's sons, and not one of them is left.\"","31":"Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth. And all his servants who were standing by tore their garments.","32":"But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, \"Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons, for Amnon alone is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day he violated his sister Tamar.","33":"Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king's sons are dead, for Amnon alone is dead.\"","34":"But Absalom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.","35":"And Jonadab said to the king, \"Behold, the king's sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about.\"","36":"And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king's sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.","37":"But Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day.","38":"So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there three years.","39":"And the spirit of the king longed to go out to Absalom, because he was comforted about Amnon, since he was dead."},"14":{"1":"Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart went out to Absalom.","2":"And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman and said to her, \"Pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning garments. Do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.","3":"Go to the king and speak thus to him.\" So Joab put the words in her mouth.","4":"When the woman of Tekoa came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and paid homage and said, \"Save me, O king.\"","5":"And the king said to her, \"What is your trouble?\" She answered, \"Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead.","6":"And your servant had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field. There was no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him.","7":"And now the whole clan has risen against your servant, and they say, 'Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed.' And so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal that is left and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth.\"","8":"Then the king said to the woman, \"Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you.\"","9":"And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, \"On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father's house; let the king and his throne be guiltless.\"","10":"The king said, \"If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again.\"","11":"Then she said, \"Please let the king invoke the LORD your God, that the avenger of blood kill no more, and my son be not destroyed.\" He said, \"As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.\"","12":"Then the woman said, \"Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king.\" He said, \"Speak.\"","13":"And the woman said, \"Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again.","14":"We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God will not take away life, and he devises means so that the banished one will not remain an outcast.","15":"Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid, and your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.","16":"For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.'","17":"And your servant thought, 'The word of my lord the king will set me at rest,' for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The LORD your God be with you!\"","18":"Then the king answered the woman, \"Do not hide from me anything I ask you.\" And the woman said, \"Let my lord the king speak.\"","19":"The king said, \"Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?\" The woman answered and said, \"As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant.","20":"In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth.\"","21":"Then the king said to Joab, \"Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom.\"","22":"And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king. And Joab said, \"Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant.\"","23":"So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.","24":"And the king said, \"Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence.\" So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king's presence.","25":"Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.","26":"And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight.","27":"There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a beautiful woman.","28":"So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king's presence.","29":"Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come.","30":"Then he said to his servants, \"See, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.\" So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.","31":"Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, \"Why have your servants set my field on fire?\"","32":"Absalom answered Joab, \"Behold, I sent word to you, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, \"Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.\" Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.'\"","33":"Then Joab went to the king and told him, and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom."},"15":{"1":"After this Absalom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.","2":"And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way of the gate. And when any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, \"From what city are you?\" And when he said, \"Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,\"","3":"Absalom would say to him, \"See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man designated by the king to hear you.\"","4":"Then Absalom would say, \"Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice.\"","5":"And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.","6":"Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.","7":"And at the end of four years Absalom said to the king, \"Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.","8":"For your servant vowed a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram, saying, 'If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the LORD.'\"","9":"The king said to him, \"Go in peace.\" So he arose and went to Hebron.","10":"But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, \"As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, 'Absalom is king at Hebron!'\"","11":"With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their innocence and knew nothing.","12":"And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Absalom kept increasing.","13":"And a messenger came to David, saying, \"The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.\"","14":"Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, \"Arise, and let us flee, or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Go quickly, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down ruin on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.\"","15":"And the king's servants said to the king, \"Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides.\"","16":"So the king went out, and all his household after him. And the king left ten concubines to keep the house.","17":"And the king went out, and all the people after him. And they halted at the last house.","18":"And all his servants passed by him, and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king.","19":"Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, \"Why do you also go with us? Go back and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home.","20":"You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, since I go I know not where? Go back and take your brothers with you, and may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you.\"","21":"But Ittai answered the king, \"As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be.\"","22":"And David said to Ittai, \"Go then, pass on.\" So Ittai the Gittite passed on with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.","23":"And all the land wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the wilderness.","24":"And Abiathar came up, and behold, Zadok came also with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God until the people had all passed out of the city.","25":"Then the king said to Zadok, \"Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his dwelling place.","26":"But if he says, 'I have no pleasure in you,' behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him.\"","27":"The king also said to Zadok the priest, \"Are you not a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.","28":"See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.\"","29":"So Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they remained there.","30":"But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered. And all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went.","31":"And it was told David, \"Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.\" And David said, \"O LORD, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.\"","32":"While David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dirt on his head.","33":"David said to him, \"If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.","34":"But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,' then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.","35":"Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king's house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.","36":"Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son, and by them you shall send to me everything you hear.\"","37":"So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem."},"16":{"1":"When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, bearing two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred of summer fruits, and a skin of wine.","2":"And the king said to Ziba, \"Why have you brought these?\" Ziba answered, \"The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who faint in the wilderness to drink.\"","3":"And the king said, \"And where is your master's son?\" Ziba said to the king, \"Behold, he remains in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.'\"","4":"Then the king said to Ziba, \"Behold, all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.\" And Ziba said, \"I pay homage; let me ever find favor in your sight, my lord the king.\"","5":"When King David came to Bahurim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera, and as he came he cursed continually.","6":"And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.","7":"And Shimei said as he cursed, \"Get out, get out, you man of blood, you worthless man!","8":"The LORD has avenged on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, your evil is on you, for you are a man of blood.\"","9":"Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, \"Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.\"","10":"But the king said, \"What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, 'Curse David,' who then shall say, 'Why have you done so?'\"","11":"And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, \"Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Leave him alone, and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.","12":"It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done to me, and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing today.\"","13":"So David and his men went on the road, while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and flung dust.","14":"And the king, and all the people who were with him, arrived weary at the Jordan. And there he refreshed himself.","15":"Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.","16":"And when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, \"Long live the king! Long live the king!\"","17":"And Absalom said to Hushai, \"Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?\"","18":"And Hushai said to Absalom, \"No, for whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain.","19":"And again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you.\"","20":"Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, \"Give your counsel. What shall we do?\"","21":"Ahithophel said to Absalom, \"Go in to your father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.\"","22":"So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof. And Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.","23":"Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed, both by David and by Absalom."},"17":{"1":"Moreover, Ahithophel said to Absalom, \"Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight.","2":"I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged and throw him into a panic, and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down only the king,","3":"and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man, and all the people will be at peace.\"","4":"And the advice seemed right in the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel.","5":"Then Absalom said, \"Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.\"","6":"And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, \"Thus has Ahithophel spoken; shall we do as he says? If not, you speak.\"","7":"Then Hushai said to Absalom, \"This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good.\"","8":"Hushai said, \"You know that your father and his men are mighty men, and that they are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the people.","9":"Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits or in some other place. And as soon as some of the people fall at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.'","10":"Then even the valiant man, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that those who are with him are valiant men.","11":"But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person.","12":"So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found, and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground, and of him and all the men with him not one will be left.","13":"If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there.\"","14":"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, \"The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.\" For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring harm upon Absalom.","15":"Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, \"Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so have I counseled.","16":"Now therefore send quickly and tell David, 'Do not stay tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.'\"","17":"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En-rogel. A female servant was to go and tell them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they were not to be seen entering the city.","18":"But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So both of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard. And they went down into it.","19":"And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth and scattered grain on it, and nothing was known of it.","20":"When Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said, \"Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?\" And the woman said to them, \"They have gone over the brook of water.\" And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.","21":"After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, \"Arise, and go quickly over the water, for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you.\"","22":"Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan. By daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.","23":"When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and went off home to his own city. He set his house in order and hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.","24":"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.","25":"Now Absalom had set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite, who had married Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.","26":"And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.","27":"When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,","28":"brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans and lentils,","29":"honey and curds and sheep and cheese from the herd, for David and the people with him to eat, for they said, \"The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.\""},"18":{"1":"Then David mustered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.","2":"And David sent out the army, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, \"I myself will also go out with you.\"","3":"But the men said, \"You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city.\"","4":"The king said to them, \"Whatever seems best to you I will do.\" So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands.","5":"And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, \"Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.\" And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.","6":"So the army went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.","7":"And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the loss there was great on that day, twenty thousand men.","8":"The battle spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword.","9":"And Absalom happened to meet the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great terebinth, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on.","10":"And a certain man saw it and told Joab, \"Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.\"","11":"Joab said to the man who told him, \"What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt.\"","12":"But the man said to Joab, \"Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not reach out my hand against the king's son, for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake protect the young man Absalom.'","13":"On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof.\"","14":"Joab said, \"I will not waste time like this with you.\" And he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak.","15":"And ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him.","16":"Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained them.","17":"And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every one to his own home.","18":"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King's Valley, for he said, \"I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.\" He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom's monument to this day.","19":"Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, \"Let me run and carry news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.\"","20":"And Joab said to him, \"You are not to carry news today.

Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.","23":"All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.\" And Araunah said to the king, \"The LORD your God accept you.\"","24":"But the king said to Araunah, \"No, but I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing.\" So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.","25":"And David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

He also overlaid an altar of cedar.","21":"And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.","22":"And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.","23":"In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high.","24":"Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.","25":"The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form.","26":"The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub.","27":"He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house. And the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house.","28":"And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.","29":"Around all the walls of the house he carved engraved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms.","30":"The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms.","31":"For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided.","32":"He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. He overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.","33":"So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square,","34":"and two doors of cypress wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.","35":"On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work.","36":"He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams.","37":"In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv.","38":"And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it."},"7":{"1":"Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire house.","2":"He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Its length was a hundred cubits and its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits, and it was built on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.","3":"And it was covered with cedar above the chambers that were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row.","4":"There were window frames in three rows, and window opposite window in three tiers.","5":"All the doorways and windows had square frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers.","6":"And he made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. There was a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy in front of them.","7":"And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, even the Hall of Judgment. It was finished with cedar from floor to rafters.","8":"His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter whom he had taken in marriage.","9":"All these were made of costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside to the great court.","10":"The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits.","11":"And above were costly stones, cut according to measurement, and cedar.","12":"The great court had three courses of cut stone all around, and a course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the LORD and the vestibule of the house.","13":"And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre.","14":"He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze. And he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon and did all his work.","15":"He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference. It was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers. The second pillar was the same.","16":"He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.","17":"There were lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars, a lattice for the one capital and a lattice for the other capital.","18":"Likewise he made pomegranates in two rows around the one latticework to cover the capital that was on the top of the pillar, and he did the same with the other capital.","19":"Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits.","20":"The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the latticework. There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows all around, and so with the other capital.","21":"He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple. He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz.","22":"And on the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.","23":"Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.","24":"Under its brim were gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.","25":"It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.","26":"Its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.","27":"He also made the ten stands of bronze. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.","28":"This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames,","29":"and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work.","30":"Moreover, each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and at the four corners were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each.","31":"Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit. Its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round.","32":"And the four wheels were underneath the panels. The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands, and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.","33":"The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.","34":"There were four supports at the four corners of each stand. The supports were of one piece with the stands.","35":"And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it.","36":"And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.","37":"After this manner he made the ten stands. All of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.","38":"And he made ten basins of bronze. Each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits, and there was a basin for each of the ten stands.","39":"And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house. And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.","40":"Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the LORD:","41":"the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;","42":"and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;","43":"the ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands;","44":"and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.","45":"Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the LORD, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze.","46":"In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.","47":"And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.","48":"So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence,","49":"the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;","50":"the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.","51":"Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD."},"8":{"1":"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.","2":"And all the men of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.","3":"And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.","4":"And they brought up the ark of the LORD, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.","5":"And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.","6":"Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.","7":"For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles.","8":"And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.","9":"There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.","10":"And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the house of the LORD,","11":"so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.","12":"Then Solomon said, \"The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.","13":"I have indeed built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever.\"","14":"Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.","15":"And he said, \"Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying,","16":"'Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there. But I chose David to be over my people Israel.'","17":"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.","18":"But the LORD said to David my father, 'Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart.","19":"Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.'","20":"Now the LORD has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.","21":"And there I have provided a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.\"","22":"Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven,","23":"and said, \"O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart,","24":"who have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. You spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day.","25":"Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.'","26":"Now therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David my father.","27":"\"But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built!","28":"Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O LORD my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you this day,","29":"that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you have said, 'My name shall be there,' that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place.","30":"And listen to the plea of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen in heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.","31":"\"If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in this house,","32":"then hear in heaven and act and judge your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.","33":"\"When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and if they turn again to you and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house,","34":"then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to their fathers.","35":"\"When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict them,","36":"then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and grant rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.","37":"\"If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar, if their enemy besieges them in the land at their gates, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,","38":"whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart and stretching out his hands toward this house,","39":"then hear in heaven your dwelling place and forgive and act and render to each whose heart you know, according to all his ways (for you, you only, know the hearts of all the children of mankind),","40":"that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers.","41":"\"Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a far country for your name's sake","42":"(for they shall hear of your great name and your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm), when he comes and prays toward this house,","43":"hear in heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by your name.","44":"\"If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to the LORD toward the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name,","45":"then hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause.","46":"\"If they sin against you--for there is no one who does not sin--and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near,","47":"yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors, saying, 'We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly,'","48":"if they repent with all their mind and with all their heart in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name,","49":"then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause","50":"and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions that they have committed against you, and grant them compassion in the sight of those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them","51":"(for they are your people, and your heritage, which you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace).","52":"Let your eyes be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Israel, giving ear to them whenever they call to you.","53":"For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be your heritage, as you declared through Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.\"","54":"Now as Solomon finished offering all this prayer and plea to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, where he had knelt with hands outstretched toward heaven.","55":"And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,","56":"\"Blessed be the LORD who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. Not one word has failed of all his good promise, which he spoke by Moses his servant.","57":"The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers.

So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.","64":"The same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to receive the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings.","65":"So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days.","66":"On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their homes joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown to David his servant and to Israel his people."},"9":{"1":"As soon as Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the king's house and all that Solomon desired to build,","2":"the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.","3":"And the LORD said to him, \"I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house that you have built, by putting my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time.","4":"And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules,","5":"then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, 'You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.'","6":"But if you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,","7":"then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples.","8":"And this house will become a heap of ruins. Everyone passing by it will be astonished and will hiss, and they will say, 'Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to this house?'","9":"Then they will say, 'Because they abandoned the LORD their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore the LORD has brought all this disaster on them.'\"","10":"At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD and the king's house,","11":"and Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold, as much as he desired, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.","12":"But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, they did not please him.","13":"Therefore he said, \"What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?\" So they are called the land of Cabul to this day.","14":"Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.","15":"And this is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon drafted to build the house of the LORD and his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer","16":"(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and had killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife;","17":"so Solomon rebuilt Gezer) and Lower Beth-horon","18":"and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,","19":"and all the store cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.","20":"All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the people of Israel--","21":"their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel were unable to devote to destruction--these Solomon drafted to be slaves, and so they are to this day.","22":"But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves. They were the soldiers, they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, his chariot commanders and his horsemen.","23":"These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work: 550 who had charge of the people who carried on the work.","24":"But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the city of David to her own house that Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo.","25":"Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built to the LORD, making offerings with it before the LORD. So he finished the house.","26":"King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.","27":"And Hiram sent with the fleet his servants, seamen who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon.","28":"And they went to Ophir and brought from there gold, 420 talents, and they brought it to King Solomon."},"10":{"1":"Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with hard questions.","2":"She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.","3":"And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her.","4":"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,","5":"the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more breath in her.","6":"And she said to the king, \"The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom,","7":"but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard.","8":"Happy are your men! Happy are your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!","9":"Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the LORD loved Israel forever, he has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness.\"","10":"Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. Never again came such an abundance of spices as these that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.","11":"Moreover, the fleet of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones.","12":"And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, also lyres and harps for the singers. No such almug wood has come or been seen to this day.","13":"And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.","14":"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,","15":"besides that which came from the explorers and from the business of the merchants, and from all the kings of the west and from the governors of the land.","16":"King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield.","17":"And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.","18":"The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with the finest gold.","19":"The throne had six steps, and at the back of the throne was a calf's head, and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests,","20":"while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom.","21":"All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.","22":"For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.","23":"Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.","24":"And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.","25":"Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.","26":"And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.","27":"And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.","28":"And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king's traders received them from Kue at a price.","29":"A chariot could be imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a horse for 150, and so through the king's traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria."},"11":{"1":"Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, along with the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women,","2":"from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the people of Israel, \"You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.\" Solomon clung to these in love.","3":"He had 700 wives, princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.","4":"For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.","5":"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.","6":"So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and did not wholly follow the LORD, as David his father had done.","7":"Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem.","8":"And so he did for all his foreign wives, who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods.","9":"And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice","10":"and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods.

He was of the royal house in Edom.","15":"For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he struck down every male in Edom","16":"(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom).","17":"But Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain Edomites of his father's servants, Hadad still being a little child.","18":"They set out from Midian and came to Paran and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him an allowance of food and gave him land.","19":"And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.","20":"And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.","21":"But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, \"Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.\"","22":"But Pharaoh said to him, \"What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country?\" And he said to him, \"Only let me depart.\"","23":"God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah.","24":"And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the killing by David. And they went to Damascus and lived there and made him king in Damascus.","25":"He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing harm as Hadad did. And he loathed Israel and reigned over Syria.","26":"Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king.","27":"And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father.","28":"The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.","29":"And at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had dressed himself in a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the open country.","30":"Then Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces.","31":"And he said to Jeroboam, \"Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes","32":"(but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),","33":"because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and they have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules, as David his father did.","34":"Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes.","35":"But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give it to you, ten tribes.","36":"Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name.","37":"And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.","38":"And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.","39":"And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this, but not forever.'\"","40":"Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.","41":"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?","42":"And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.","43":"And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father.

Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.\"","5":"He said to them, \"Go away for three days, then come again to me.\" So the people went away.","6":"Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, \"How do you advise me to answer this people?\"","7":"And they said to him, \"If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever.\"","8":"But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.","9":"And he said to them, \"What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?\"","10":"And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, \"Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,' thus shall you say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs.","11":"And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'\"","12":"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, \"Come to me again the third day.\"","13":"And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel that the old men had given him,","14":"he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, \"My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.\"","15":"So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfill his word, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","16":"And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, \"What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.\" So Israel went to their tents.","17":"But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.","18":"Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.","19":"So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.","20":"And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David but the tribe of Judah only.","21":"When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.","22":"But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:","23":"\"Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,","24":"'Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives the people of Israel. Every man return to his home, for this thing is from me.'\" So they listened to the word of the LORD and went home again, according to the word of the LORD.","25":"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And he went out from there and built Penuel.","26":"And Jeroboam said in his heart, \"Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David.","27":"If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of the LORD at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.\"","28":"So the king took counsel and made two calves of gold. And he said to the people, \"You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.\"","29":"And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.","30":"Then this thing became a sin, for the people went as far as Dan to be before one.","31":"He also made temples on high places and appointed priests from among all the people, who were not of the Levites.","32":"And Jeroboam appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made.","33":"He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised from his own heart. And he instituted a feast for the people of Israel and went up to the altar to make offerings."},"13":{"1":"And behold, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel.

And he said to him, \"Are you the man of God who came from Judah?\" And he said, \"I am.\"","15":"Then he said to him, \"Come home with me and eat bread.\"","16":"And he said, \"I may not return with you, or go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place,","17":"for it was said to me by the word of the LORD, 'You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.'\"","18":"And he said to him, \"I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water.'\" But he lied to him.","19":"So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.","20":"And as they sat at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back.","21":"And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, \"Thus says the LORD, 'Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD and have not kept the command that the LORD your God commanded you,","22":"but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, \"Eat no bread and drink no water,\" your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.'\"","23":"And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.","24":"And as he went away a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body.","25":"And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown in the road and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.","26":"And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, \"It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the LORD; therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word that the LORD spoke to him.\"","27":"And he said to his sons, \"Saddle the donkey for me.\" And they saddled it.","28":"And he went and found his body thrown in the road, and the donkey and the lion standing beside the body.

And he called to her and said, \"Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.\"","11":"And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, \"Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.\"","12":"And she said, \"As the LORD your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. And now I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it and die.\"","13":"And Elijah said to her, \"Do not fear; go and do as you have said. But first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make something for yourself and your son.","14":"For thus says the LORD the God of Israel, 'The jar of flour shall not be spent, and the jug of oil shall not be empty, until the day that the LORD sends rain upon the earth.'\"","15":"And she went and did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days.","16":"The jar of flour was not spent, neither did the jug of oil become empty, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke by Elijah.","17":"After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill.

You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to cause the death of my son!\"","19":"And he said to her, \"Give me your son.\" And he took him from her arms and carried him up into the upper chamber where he lodged, and laid him on his own bed.","20":"And he cried to the LORD, \"O LORD my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son?\"","21":"Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the LORD, \"O LORD my God, let this child's life come into him again.\"","22":"And the LORD listened to the voice of Elijah. And the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.","23":"And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house and delivered him to his mother.

Now the famine was severe in Samaria.","3":"And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly,","4":"and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.)","5":"And Ahab said to Obadiah, \"Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.\"","6":"So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.","7":"And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said, \"Is it you, my lord Elijah?\"","8":"And he answered him, \"It is I. Go, tell your lord, 'Behold, Elijah is here.'\"","9":"And he said, \"How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?","10":"As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they would say, 'He is not here,' he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you.","11":"And now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, \"Behold, Elijah is here.\"'","12":"And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where. And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth.","13":"Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water?","14":"And now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, \"Behold, Elijah is here\"'; and he will kill me.\"","15":"And Elijah said, \"As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.\"","16":"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.","17":"When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, \"Is it you, you troubler of Israel?\"","18":"And he answered, \"I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father's house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals.","19":"Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.\"","20":"So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.","21":"And Elijah came near to all the people and said, \"How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\" And the people did not answer him a word.","22":"Then Elijah said to the people, \"I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal's prophets are 450 men.","23":"Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it.

And they limped around the altar that they had made.","27":"And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, \"Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.\"","28":"And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them.","29":"And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.","30":"Then Elijah said to all the people, \"Come near to me.\" And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down.","31":"Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, \"Israel shall be your name,\"","32":"and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed.","33":"And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, \"Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.\"","34":"And he said, \"Do it a second time.\" And they did it a second time. And he said, \"Do it a third time.\" And they did it a third time.","35":"And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.","36":"And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, \"O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.","37":"Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.\"","38":"Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.","39":"And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, \"The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.\"","40":"And Elijah said to them, \"Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.\" And they seized them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there.","41":"And Elijah said to Ahab, \"Go up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of the rushing of rain.\"","42":"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel. And he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees.","43":"And he said to his servant, \"Go up now, look toward the sea.\" And he went up and looked and said, \"There is nothing.\" And he said, \"Go again,\" seven times.","44":"And at the seventh time he said, \"Behold, a little cloud like a man's hand is rising from the sea.\" And he said, \"Go up, say to Ahab, 'Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.'\"","45":"And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.

And he asked that he might die, saying, \"It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.\"","5":"And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, \"Arise and eat.\"","6":"And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again.","7":"And the angel of the LORD came again a second time and touched him and said, \"Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.\"","8":"And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.","9":"There he came to a cave and lodged in it. And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\"","10":"He said, \"I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.\"","11":"And he said, \"Go out and stand on the mount before the LORD.\" And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.","12":"And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper.","13":"And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him and said, \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\"","14":"He said, \"I have been very jealous for the LORD, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.\"","15":"And the LORD said to him, \"Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.","16":"And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.","17":"And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death.","18":"Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.\"","19":"So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him, and he was with the twelfth.

Was it a time to accept money and garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male servants and female servants?","27":"Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.\" So he went out from his presence a leper, like snow."},"6":{"1":"Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, \"See, the place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us.","2":"Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there.\" And he answered, \"Go.\"","3":"Then one of them said, \"Be pleased to go with your servants.\" And he answered, \"I will go.\"","4":"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.","5":"But as one was felling a log, his axe head fell into the water, and he cried out, \"Alas, my master! It was borrowed.\"","6":"Then the man of God said, \"Where did it fall?\" When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick and threw it in there and made the iron float.","7":"And he said, \"Take it up.\" So he reached out his hand and took it.","8":"Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, \"At such and such a place shall be my camp.\"","9":"But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, \"Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there.\"","10":"And the king of Israel sent to the place about which the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.","11":"And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing, and he called his servants and said to them, \"Will you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?\"","12":"And one of his servants said, \"None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.\"","13":"And he said, \"Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him.\" It was told him, \"Behold, he is in Dothan.\"","14":"So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army, and they came by night and surrounded the city.","15":"When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said, \"Alas, my master! What shall we do?\"","16":"He said, \"Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\"","17":"Then Elisha prayed and said, \"O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see.\" So the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.","18":"And when the Syrians came down against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD and said, \"Please strike this people with blindness.\" So he struck them with blindness in accordance with the prayer of Elisha.","19":"And Elisha said to them, \"This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.\" And he led them to Samaria.","20":"As soon as they entered Samaria, Elisha said, \"O LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.\" So the LORD opened their eyes and they saw, and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.","21":"As soon as the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, \"My father, shall I strike them down? Shall I strike them down?\"","22":"He answered, \"You shall not strike them down. Would you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.\"","23":"So he prepared for them a great feast, and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the Syrians did not come again on raids into the land of Israel.","24":"Afterward Ben-hadad king of Syria mustered his entire army and went up and besieged Samaria.","25":"And there was a great famine in Samaria, as they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver.","26":"Now as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, \"Help, my lord, O king!\"","27":"And he said, \"If the LORD will not help you, how shall I help you? From the threshing floor, or from the winepress?\"","28":"And the king asked her, \"What is your trouble?\" She answered, \"This woman said to me, 'Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'","29":"So we boiled my son and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, 'Give your son, that we may eat him.' But she has hidden her son.\"","30":"When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes--now he was passing by on the wall--and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath on his body--","31":"and he said, \"May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today.\"","32":"Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Now the king had dispatched a man from his presence, but before the messenger arrived Elisha said to the elders, \"Do you see how this murderer has sent to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?\"","33":"And while he was still speaking with them, the messenger came down to him and said, \"This trouble is from the LORD! Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?\""},"7":{"1":"But Elisha said, \"Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the LORD, Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.\"","2":"Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned said to the man of God, \"If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?\" But he said, \"You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.\"","3":"Now there were four men who were lepers at the entrance to the gate. And they said to one another, \"Why are we sitting here until we die?","4":"If we say, 'Let us enter the city,' the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die.\"","5":"So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians. But when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no one there.","6":"For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, \"Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us.\"","7":"So they fled away in the twilight and abandoned their tents, their horses, and their donkeys, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives.","8":"And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent and ate and drank, and they carried off silver and gold and clothing and went and hid them. Then they came back and entered another tent and carried off things from it and went and hid them.","9":"Then they said to one another, \"We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news. If we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us. Now therefore come; let us go and tell the king's household.\"","10":"So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city and told them, \"We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied and the donkeys tied and the tents as they were.\"","11":"Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king's household.","12":"And the king rose in the night and said to his servants, \"I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country, thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive and get into the city.'\"","13":"And one of his servants said, \"Let some men take five of the remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel who have already perished. Let us send and see.\"","14":"So they took two horsemen, and the king sent them after the army of the Syrians, saying, \"Go and see.\"","15":"So they went after them as far as the Jordan, and behold, all the way was littered with garments and equipment that the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.","16":"Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.","17":"Now the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. And the people trampled him in the gate, so that he died, as the man of God had said when the king came down to him.","18":"For when the man of God had said to the king, \"Two seahs of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria,\"","19":"the captain had answered the man of God, \"If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?\" And he had said, \"You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it.\"","20":"And so it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate and he died."},"8":{"1":"Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, \"Arise, and depart with your household, and sojourn wherever you can, for the LORD has called for a famine, and it will come upon the land for seven years.\"","2":"So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God. She went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.","3":"And at the end of the seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to appeal to the king for her house and her land.","4":"Now the king was talking with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, \"Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.\"","5":"And while he was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life appealed to the king for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, \"My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life.\"","6":"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed an official for her, saying, \"Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.\"","7":"Now Elisha came to Damascus. Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick. And when it was told him, \"The man of God has come here,\"","8":"the king said to Hazael, \"Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD through him, saying, 'Shall I recover from this sickness?'\"","9":"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camel loads. When he came and stood before him, he said, \"Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, 'Shall I recover from this sickness?'\"","10":"And Elisha said to him, \"Go, say to him, 'You shall certainly recover,' but the LORD has shown me that he shall certainly die.\"","11":"And he fixed his gaze and stared at him, until he was embarrassed. And the man of God wept.","12":"And Hazael said, \"Why does my lord weep?\" He answered, \"Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel. You will set on fire their fortresses, and you will kill their young men with the sword and dash in pieces their little ones and rip open their pregnant women.\"","13":"And Hazael said, \"What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?\" Elisha answered, \"The LORD has shown me that you are to be king over Syria.\"","14":"Then he departed from Elisha and came to his master, who said to him, \"What did Elisha say to you?\" And he answered, \"He told me that you would certainly recover.\"","15":"But the next day he took the bed cloth and dipped it in water and spread it over his face, till he died. And Hazael became king in his place.","16":"In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, began to reign.","17":"He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.","18":"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.","19":"Yet the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant, since he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.","20":"In his days Edom revolted from the rule of Judah and set up a king of their own.","21":"Then Joram passed over to Zair with all his chariots and rose by night, and he and his chariot commanders struck the Edomites who had surrounded him, but his army fled home.","22":"So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.","23":"Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?","24":"So Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.","25":"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.","26":"Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah; she was a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.","27":"He also walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was son-in-law to the house of Ahab.","28":"He went with Joram the son of Ahab to make war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead, and the Syrians wounded Joram.","29":"And King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."},"9":{"1":"Then Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, \"Tie up your garments, and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.","2":"And when you arrive, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi. And go in and have him rise from among his fellows, and lead him to an inner chamber.","3":"Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, 'Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and flee; do not linger.\"","4":"So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.","5":"And when he came, behold, the commanders of the army were in council. And he said, \"I have a word for you, O commander.\" And Jehu said, \"To which of us all?\" And he said, \"To you, O commander.\"","6":"So he arose and went into the house. And the young man poured the oil on his head, saying to him, \"Thus says the LORD the God of Israel, I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.","7":"And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD.","8":"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.","9":"And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.","10":"And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her.\" Then he opened the door and fled.","11":"When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they said to him, \"Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?\" And he said to them, \"You know the fellow and his talk.\"","12":"And they said, \"That is not true; tell us now.\" And he said, \"Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, 'Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.'\"","13":"Then in haste every man of them took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps, and they blew the trumpet and proclaimed, \"Jehu is king.\"","14":"Thus Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram with all Israel had been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Syria,","15":"but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) So Jehu said, \"If this is your decision, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.\"","16":"Then Jehu mounted his chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to visit Joram.","17":"Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came and said, \"I see a company.\" And Joram said, \"Take a horseman and send to meet them, and let him say, 'Is it peace?'\"","18":"So a man on horseback went to meet him and said, \"Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'\" And Jehu said, \"What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me.\" And the watchman reported, saying, \"The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.\"","19":"Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said, \"Thus the king has said, 'Is it peace?'\" And Jehu answered, \"What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me.\"","20":"Again the watchman reported, \"He reached them, but he is not coming back. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.\"","21":"Joram said, \"Make ready.\" And they made ready his chariot. Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his chariot, and went to meet Jehu, and met him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.","22":"And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, \"Is it peace, Jehu?\" He answered, \"What peace can there be, so long as the whorings and the sorceries of your mother Jezebel are so many?\"","23":"Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahaziah, \"Treachery, O Ahaziah!\"","24":"And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart, and he sank in his chariot.","25":"Jehu said to Bidkar his aide, \"Take him up and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember, when you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father, how the LORD made this pronouncement against him:","26":"'As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons--declares the LORD--I will repay you on this plot of ground.' Now therefore take him up and throw him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the LORD.\"","27":"When Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him and said, \"Shoot him also.\" And they shot him in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo and died there.","28":"His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.","29":"In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.","30":"When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. And she painted her eyes and adorned her head and looked out of the window.","31":"And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, \"Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?\"","32":"And he lifted up his face to the window and said, \"Who is on my side? Who?\" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.","33":"He said, \"Throw her down.\" So they threw her down. And some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled on her.","34":"Then he went in and ate and drank. And he said, \"See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.\"","35":"But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.","36":"When they came back and told him, he said, \"This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, 'In the territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel,","37":"and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one can say, This is Jezebel.'\""},"10":{"1":"Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the rulers of the city, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying,","2":"\"Now then, as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities also, and weapons,","3":"select the best and fittest of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne and fight for your master's house.\"","4":"But they were exceedingly afraid and said, \"Behold, the two kings could not stand before him. How then can we stand?\"","5":"So he who was over the palace, and he who was over the city, together with the elders and the guardians, sent to Jehu, saying, \"We are your servants, and we will do all that you tell us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your eyes.\"","6":"Then he wrote to them a second letter, saying, \"If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time.\" Now the king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were bringing them up.","7":"And as soon as the letter came to them, they took the king's sons and slaughtered them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.","8":"When the messenger came and told him, \"They have brought the heads of the king's sons,\" he said, \"Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.\"","9":"Then in the morning, when he went out, he stood and said to all the people, \"You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who struck down all these?","10":"Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab, for the LORD has done what he said by his servant Elijah.\"","11":"So Jehu struck down all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, all his great men and his close friends and his priests, until he left him none remaining.","12":"Then he set out and went to Samaria. On the way, when he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,","13":"Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah, and he said, \"Who are you?\" And they answered, \"We are the relatives of Ahaziah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother.\"","14":"He said, \"Take them alive.\" And they took them alive and slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two persons, and he spared none of them.","15":"And when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. And he greeted him and said to him, \"Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours?\" And Jehonadab answered, \"It is.\" Jehu said, \"If it is, give me your hand.\" So he gave him his hand. And Jehu took him up with him into the chariot.","16":"And he said, \"Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD.\" So he had him ride in his chariot.","17":"And when he came to Samaria, he struck down all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had wiped them out, according to the word of the LORD that he spoke to Elijah.","18":"Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, \"Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much.","19":"Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests. Let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live.\" But Jehu did it with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal.","20":"And Jehu ordered, \"Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.\" So they proclaimed it.","21":"And Jehu sent throughout all Israel, and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they entered the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.","22":"He said to him who was in charge of the wardrobe, \"Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Baal.\" So he brought out the vestments for them.","23":"Then Jehu went into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab, and he said to the worshipers of Baal, \"Search, and see that there is no servant of the LORD here among you, but only the worshipers of Baal.\"","24":"Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and said, \"The man who allows any of those whom I give into your hands to escape shall forfeit his life.\"","25":"So as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guard and to the officers, \"Go in and strike them down; let not a man escape.\" So when they put them to the sword, the guard and the officers cast them out and went into the inner room of the house of Baal,","26":"and they brought out the pillar that was in the house of Baal and burned it.","27":"And they demolished the pillar of Baal, and demolished the house of Baal, and made it a latrine to this day.","28":"Thus Jehu wiped out Baal from Israel.","29":"But Jehu did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin--that is, the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan.","30":"And the LORD said to Jehu, \"Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.\"","31":"But Jehu was not careful to walk in the law of the LORD the God of Israel with all his heart. He did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam, which he made Israel to sin.","32":"In those days the LORD began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel:","33":"from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the Valley of the Arnon, that is, Gilead and Bashan.","34":"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?","35":"So Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.","36":"The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years."},"11":{"1":"Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family.","2":"But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king's sons who were being put to death, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Thus they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not put to death.","3":"And he remained with her six years, hidden in the house of the LORD, while Athaliah reigned over the land.","4":"But in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of the Carites and of the guards, and had them come to him in the house of the LORD. And he made a covenant with them and put them under oath in the house of the LORD, and he showed them the king's son.","5":"And he commanded them, \"This is the thing that you shall do: one third of you, those who come off duty on the Sabbath and guard the king's house","6":"(another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards) shall guard the palace.","7":"And the two divisions of you, which come on duty in force on the Sabbath and guard the house of the LORD on behalf of the king,","8":"shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand. And whoever approaches the ranks is to be put to death. Be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in.\"","9":"The captains did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and they each brought his men who were to go off duty on the Sabbath, with those who were to come on duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.","10":"And the priest gave to the captains the spears and shields that had been King David's, which were in the house of the LORD.","11":"And the guards stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house on behalf of the king.","12":"Then he brought out the king's son and put the crown on him and gave him the testimony. And they proclaimed him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, \"Long live the king!\"","13":"When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she went into the house of the LORD to the people.","14":"And when she looked, there was the king standing by the pillar, according to the custom, and the captains and the trumpeters beside the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets. And Athaliah tore her clothes and cried, \"Treason!

Therefore he has brought all this disaster on them.'\""},"8":{"1":"At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house,","2":"Solomon rebuilt the cities that Hiram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them.","3":"And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and took it.","4":"He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath.","5":"He also built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,","6":"and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.","7":"All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,","8":"from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed--these Solomon drafted as forced labor, and so they are to this day.","9":"But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.","10":"And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, 250, who exercised authority over the people.","11":"Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, \"My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy.\"","12":"Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD that he had built before the vestibule,","13":"as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual feasts--the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.","14":"According to the ruling of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their offices of praise and ministry before the priests as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate, for so David the man of God had commanded.","15":"And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries.","16":"Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from the day the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.","17":"Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom.","18":"And Hiram sent to him by the hand of his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea, and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon and brought from there 450 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon."},"9":{"1":"Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions, having a very great retinue and camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind.","2":"And Solomon answered all her questions. There was nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain to her.","3":"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,","4":"the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their clothing, his cupbearers, and their clothing, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the LORD, there was no more breath in her.","5":"And she said to the king, \"The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom,","6":"but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, half the greatness of your wisdom was not told me; you surpass the report that I heard.","7":"Happy are your wives! Happy are these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!","8":"Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on his throne as king for the LORD your God! Because your God loved Israel and would establish them forever, he has made you king over them, that you may execute justice and righteousness.\"","9":"Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There were no spices such as those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.","10":"Moreover, the servants of Hiram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones.","11":"And the king made from the algum wood supports for the house of the LORD and for the king's house, lyres also and harps for the singers. There never was seen the like of them before in the land of Judah.","12":"And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants.","13":"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold,","14":"besides that which the explorers and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.","15":"King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of beaten gold went into each shield.","16":"And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; 300 shekels of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.","17":"The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.","18":"The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests,","19":"while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. Nothing like it was ever made for any kingdom.","20":"All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.","21":"For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.","22":"Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.","23":"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.","24":"Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and of gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.","25":"And Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.","26":"And he ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt.","27":"And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah.","28":"And horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.","29":"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, from first to last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?","30":"Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.","31":"And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place."},"10":{"1":"Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.","2":"And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt.","3":"And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and said to Rehoboam,","4":"\"Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you.\"","5":"He said to them, \"Come to me again in three days.\" So the people went away.","6":"Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, \"How do you advise me to answer this people?\"","7":"And they said to him, \"If you will be good to this people and please them and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.\"","8":"But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him.","9":"And he said to them, \"What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?\"","10":"And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, \"Thus shall you speak to the people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us'; thus shall you say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs.","11":"And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'\"","12":"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, \"Come to me again the third day.\"","13":"And the king answered them harshly; and forsaking the counsel of the old men,","14":"King Rehoboam spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, \"My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.\"","15":"So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by God that the LORD might fulfill his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.","16":"And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, \"What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Each of you to your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.\" So all Israel went to their tents.","17":"But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah.","18":"Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and the people of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam quickly mounted his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.","19":"So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day."},"11":{"1":"When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.","2":"But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:","3":"\"Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,","4":"'Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives. Return every man to his home, for this thing is from me.'\" So they listened to the word of the LORD and returned and did not go against Jeroboam.","5":"Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built cities for defense in Judah.","6":"He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,","7":"Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,","8":"Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,","9":"Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,","10":"Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, fortified cities that are in Judah and in Benjamin.","11":"He made the fortresses strong, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine.","12":"And he put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong. So he held Judah and Benjamin.","13":"And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all places where they lived.","14":"For the Levites left their common lands and their holdings and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons cast them out from serving as priests of the LORD,","15":"and he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat idols and for the calves that he had made.","16":"And those who had set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came after them from all the tribes of Israel to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers.","17":"They strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon secure, for they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.","18":"Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse,","19":"and she bore him sons, Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.","20":"After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.","21":"Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines (he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters).","22":"And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king.","23":"And he dealt wisely and distributed some of his sons through all the districts of Judah and Benjamin, in all the fortified cities, and he gave them abundant provisions and procured wives for them."},"12":{"1":"When the rule of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.","2":"In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem","3":"with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen.

I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.","8":"Nevertheless, they shall be servants to him, that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.\"","9":"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house. He took away everything. He also took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made,","10":"and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.","11":"And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard came and carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.","12":"And when he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction.

Whoever comes for ordination with a young bull or seven rams becomes a priest of what are no gods.","10":"But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests ministering to the LORD who are sons of Aaron, and Levites for their service.","11":"They offer to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt offerings and incense of sweet spices, set out the showbread on the table of pure gold, and care for the golden lampstand that its lamps may burn every evening.

Let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. They are coming to kill you by night.\"","11":"But I said, \"Should such a man as I run away? And what man such as I could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.\"","12":"And I understood and saw that God had not sent him, but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.","13":"For this purpose he was hired, that I should be afraid and act in this way and sin, and so they could give me a bad name in order to taunt me.","14":"Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid.","15":"So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.","16":"And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations around us were afraid and fell greatly in their own esteem, for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.","17":"Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them.","18":"For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah: and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as his wife.","19":"Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to make me afraid."},"7":{"1":"Now when the wall had been built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,","2":"I gave my brother Hanani and Hananiah the governor of the castle charge over Jerusalem, for he was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many.","3":"And I said to them, \"Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot.

And he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her portion of food, and with seven chosen young women from the king's palace, and advanced her and her young women to the best place in the harem.","10":"Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mordecai had commanded her not to make it known.","11":"And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her.","12":"Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women--","13":"when the young woman went in to the king in this way, she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.","14":"In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second harem in custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who was in charge of the concubines. She would not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.","15":"When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king's eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther was winning favor in the eyes of all who saw her.","16":"And when Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign,","17":"the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.","18":"Then the king gave a great feast for all his officials and servants; it was Esther's feast. He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity.","19":"Now when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.","20":"Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had commanded her, for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him.","21":"In those days, as Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.","22":"And this came to the knowledge of Mordecai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai.","23":"When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows. And it was recorded in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king."},"3":{"1":"After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him.","2":"And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage.","3":"Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, \"Why do you transgress the king's command?\"","4":"And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai's words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew.","5":"And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with fury.","6":"But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.","7":"In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.","8":"Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, \"There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king's laws, so that it is not to the king's profit to tolerate them.","9":"If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business, that they may put it into the king's treasuries.\"","10":"So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews.","11":"And the king said to Haman, \"The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.\"","12":"Then the king's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king's satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's signet ring.","13":"Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with instruction to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.","14":"A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day.","15":"The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion."},"4":{"1":"When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and he cried out with a loud and bitter cry.","2":"He went up to the entrance of the king's gate, for no one was allowed to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth.","3":"And in every province, wherever the king's command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and many of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.","4":"When Esther's young women and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed. She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.","5":"Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was.","6":"Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate,","7":"and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.","8":"Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people.","9":"And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said.","10":"Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai and say,","11":"\"All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law--to be put to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live. But as for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.\"","12":"And they told Mordecai what Esther had said.","13":"Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, \"Do not think to yourself that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews.","14":"For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?\"","15":"Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai,","16":"\"Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my young women will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish.\"","17":"Mordecai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him."},"5":{"1":"On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, in front of the king's quarters, while the king was sitting on his royal throne inside the throne room opposite the entrance to the palace.","2":"And when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she won favor in his sight, and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.","3":"And the king said to her, \"What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom.\"","4":"And Esther said, \"If it please the king, let the king and Haman come today to a feast that I have prepared for the king.\"","5":"Then the king said, \"Bring Haman quickly, so that we may do as Esther has asked.\" So the king and Haman came to the feast that Esther had prepared.","6":"And as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king said to Esther, \"What is your wish? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.\"","7":"Then Esther answered, \"My wish and my request is:","8":"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my wish and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come to the feast that I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said.\"","9":"And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.","10":"Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home, and he sent and brought his friends and his wife Zeresh.","11":"And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the officials and the servants of the king.","12":"Then Haman said, \"Even Queen Esther let no one but me come with the king to the feast she prepared. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.","13":"Yet all this is worth nothing to me, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.\"","14":"Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, \"Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mordecai hanged upon it. Then go joyfully with the king to the feast.\" This idea pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made."},"6":{"1":"On that night the king could not sleep. And he gave orders to bring the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.","2":"And it was found written how Mordecai had told about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.","3":"And the king said, \"What honor or distinction has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?\" The king's young men who attended him said, \"Nothing has been done for him.\"","4":"And the king said, \"Who is in the court?\" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him.","5":"And the king's young men told him, \"Haman is there, standing in the court.\" And the king said, \"Let him come in.\"","6":"So Haman came in, and the king said to him, \"What should be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?\" And Haman said to himself, \"Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?\"","7":"And Haman said to the king, \"For the man whom the king delights to honor,","8":"let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse that the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown is set.","9":"And let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble officials. Let them dress the man whom the king delights to honor, and let them lead him on the horse through the square of the city, proclaiming before him: 'Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.'\"","10":"Then the king said to Haman, \"Hurry; take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned.\"","11":"So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he dressed Mordecai and led him through the square of the city, proclaiming before him, \"Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.\"","12":"Then Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.","13":"And Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, \"If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him.\"","14":"While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hurried to bring Haman to the feast that Esther had prepared."},"7":{"1":"So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther.","2":"And on the second day, as they were drinking wine after the feast, the king again said to Esther, \"What is your wish, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.\"","3":"Then Queen Esther answered, \"If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be granted me for my wish, and my people for my request.","4":"For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have been silent, for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king.\"","5":"Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, \"Who is he, and where is he, who has dared to do this?\"","6":"And Esther said, \"A foe and enemy! This wicked Haman!\" Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.","7":"And the king arose in his wrath from the wine-drinking and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm was determined against him by the king.","8":"And the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. And the king said, \"Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?\" As the word left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman's face.","9":"Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, \"Moreover, the gallows that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, is standing at Haman's house, fifty cubits high.\"","10":"And the king said, \"Hang him on that.\" So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the wrath of the king abated."},"8":{"1":"On that day King Ahasuerus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her.","2":"And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.","3":"Then Esther spoke again to the king. She fell at his feet and wept and pleaded with him to avert the evil plan of Haman the Agagite and the plot that he had devised against the Jews.","4":"When the king held out the golden scepter to Esther,","5":"Esther rose and stood before the king.

Or how can I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?\"","7":"Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, \"Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he intended to lay hands on the Jews.","8":"But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king's ring, for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's ring cannot be revoked.\"","9":"The king's scribes were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day. And an edict was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, 127 provinces, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language.","10":"And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's signet ring. Then he sent the letters by mounted couriers riding on swift horses that were used in the king's service, bred from the royal stud,","11":"saying that the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, children and women included, and to plunder their goods,","12":"on one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.","13":"A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, being publicly displayed to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to take vengeance on their enemies.","14":"So the couriers, mounted on their swift horses that were used in the king's service, rode out hurriedly, urged by the king's command. And the decree was issued in Susa the citadel.","15":"Then Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown and a robe of fine linen and purple, and the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.","16":"The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor.","17":"And in every province and in every city, wherever the king's command and his edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for fear of the Jews had fallen on them."},"9":{"1":"Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's command and edict were about to be carried out, on the very day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain the mastery over them, the reverse occurred: the Jews gained mastery over those who hated them.","2":"The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen on all peoples.","3":"All the officials of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and the royal agents also helped the Jews, for the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.","4":"For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces, for the man Mordecai grew more and more powerful.","5":"The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.","6":"In Susa the citadel itself the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men,","7":"and also killed Parshandatha and Dalphon and Aspatha","8":"and Poratha and Adalia and Aridatha","9":"and Parmashta and Arisai and Aridai and Vaizatha,","10":"the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, but they laid no hand on the plunder.","11":"That very day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was reported to the king.","12":"And the king said to Queen Esther, \"In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and also the ten sons of Haman.

It shall be fulfilled.\"","13":"And Esther said, \"If it please the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day's edict. And let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows.\"","14":"So the king commanded this to be done. A decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.","15":"The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed 300 men in Susa, but they laid no hands on the plunder.","16":"Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king's provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies and killed 75,000 of those who hated them, but they laid no hands on the plunder.","17":"This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness.","18":"But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of feasting and gladness.","19":"Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the rural towns, hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting, as a holiday, and as a day on which they send gifts of food to one another.","20":"And Mordecai recorded these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,","21":"obliging them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year,","22":"as the days on which the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending gifts of food to one another and gifts to the poor.","23":"So the Jews accepted what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them.","24":"For Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur (that is, cast lots), to crush and to destroy them.","25":"But when it came before the king, he gave orders in writing that his evil plan that he had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.","26":"Therefore they called these days Purim, after the term Pur. Therefore, because of all that was written in this letter, and of what they had faced in this matter, and of what had happened to them,","27":"the Jews firmly obligated themselves and their offspring and all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two days according to what was written and at the time appointed every year,","28":"that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, in every clan, province, and city, and that these days of Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the commemoration of these days cease among their descendants.","29":"Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew gave full written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim.","30":"Letters were sent to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, in words of peace and truth,","31":"that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed seasons, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther obligated them, and as they had obligated themselves and their offspring, with regard to their fasts and their lamenting.","32":"The command of Queen Esther confirmed these practices of Purim, and it was recorded in writing."},"10":{"1":"King Ahasuerus imposed tax on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.","2":"And all the acts of his power and might, and the full account of the high honor of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?","3":"For Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Ahasuerus, and he was great among the Jews and popular with the multitude of his brothers, for he sought the welfare of his people and spoke peace to all his people."}},"Job":{"1":{"1":"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.","2":"There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.","3":"He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.","4":"His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.","5":"And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all.

There is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.","9":"All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun, when man had power over man to his hurt.","10":"Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.","11":"Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil.","12":"Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him.","13":"But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he does not fear before God.","14":"There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.","15":"And I commend joy, for man has no good thing under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.","16":"When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on earth, how neither day nor night do one's eyes see sleep,","17":"then I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun.

Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.","4":"But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.","5":"For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.","6":"Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun.","7":"Go, eat your bread in joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.","8":"Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head.","9":"Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.","10":"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.","11":"Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all.","12":"For man does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.","13":"I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.","14":"There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.","15":"But there was found in it a poor, wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.","16":"But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.","17":"The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.","18":"Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good."},"10":{"1":"Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give off a stench; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.","2":"A wise man's heart inclines him to the right, but a fool's heart to the left.","3":"Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.","4":"If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your place, for calmness will lay great offenses to rest.","5":"There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were an error proceeding from the ruler:","6":"folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place.","7":"I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves.","8":"He who digs a pit will fall into it, and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.","9":"He who quarries stones is hurt by them, and he who splits logs is endangered by them.","10":"If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed.","11":"If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer.","12":"The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him.","13":"The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is evil madness.","14":"A fool multiplies words, though no man knows what is to be, and who can tell him what will be after him?","15":"The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.","16":"Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!","17":"Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility, and your princes feast at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!","18":"Through sloth the roof sinks in, and through indolence the house leaks.","19":"Bread is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, and money answers everything.","20":"Even in your thought, do not curse the king, nor in your bedroom curse the rich, for a bird of the air will carry your voice, or some winged creature tell the matter."},"11":{"1":"Cast your bread upon the waters, for you will find it after many days.","2":"Give a portion to seven, or even to eight, for you know not what disaster may happen on earth.","3":"If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth, and if a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.","4":"He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap.","5":"As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.","6":"In the morning sow your seed, and at evening withhold not your hand, for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good.","7":"Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.","8":"So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many.

And he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god.","3":"Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility,","4":"youths without blemish, of good appearance and skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king's palace, and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.","5":"The king assigned them a daily portion of the food that the king ate, and of the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king.","6":"Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah.","7":"And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.","8":"But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food, or with the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself.","9":"And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs,","10":"and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, \"I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king.\"","11":"Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,","12":"\"Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.","13":"Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see.\"","14":"So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days.","15":"At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king's food.","16":"So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.","17":"As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.","18":"At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.","19":"And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.

This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening.","32":"The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze,","33":"its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.","34":"As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.","35":"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.","36":"\"This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation.","37":"You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory,","38":"and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all--you are the head of gold.","39":"Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.","40":"And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these.","41":"And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay.","42":"And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.","43":"As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.","44":"And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever,","45":"just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A great God has made known to the king what shall be after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure.\"","46":"Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him.","47":"The king answered and said to Daniel, \"Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery.\"","48":"Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.","49":"Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon.

So they brought these men before the king.","14":"Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, \"Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?","15":"Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, well and good. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?\"","16":"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.","17":"If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.","18":"But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.\"","19":"Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated.","20":"And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.","21":"Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace.","22":"Because the king's order was urgent and the furnace overheated, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.","23":"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.","24":"Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste.

The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.","13":"\"I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven.","14":"He proclaimed aloud and said thus: 'Chop down the tree and lop off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches.","15":"But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of heaven. Let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.","16":"Let his mind be changed from a man's, and let a beast's mind be given to him; and let seven periods of time pass over him.","17":"The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of men.'","18":"This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw.

The king answered and said, \"Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you.\" Belteshazzar answered and said, \"My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies!","20":"The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth,","21":"whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose branches the birds of the heavens lived--","22":"it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.","23":"And because the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven periods of time pass over him,'","24":"this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king,","25":"that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like an ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven periods of time shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.","26":"And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be confirmed for you from the time that you know that Heaven rules.","27":"Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your prosperity.\"","28":"All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.","29":"At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,","30":"and the king answered and said, \"Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?\"","31":"While the words were still in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, \"O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you,","32":"and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field.

He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles' feathers, and his nails were like birds' claws.","34":"At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;","35":"all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, \"What have you done?\"","36":"At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and still more greatness was added to me.","37":"Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble."},"5":{"1":"King Belshazzar made a great feast for a thousand of his lords and drank wine in front of the thousand.","2":"Belshazzar, when he tasted the wine, commanded that the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem be brought, that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.","3":"Then they brought in the golden vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.","4":"They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.","5":"Immediately the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace, opposite the lampstand.

In the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father--your father the king--made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers,","12":"because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.\"","13":"Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, \"You are that Daniel, one of the exiles of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah.","14":"I have heard of you that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you.","15":"Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation, but they could not show the interpretation of the matter.","16":"But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold around your neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.\"","17":"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, \"Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation.","18":"O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty.","19":"And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him.

Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it.","5":"And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, 'Arise, devour much flesh.'","6":"After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it.","7":"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.","8":"I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.","9":"As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of days took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames; its wheels were burning fire.","10":"A stream of fire issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.","11":"I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking.

So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things.","17":"'These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth.","18":"But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.'","19":"\"Then I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet,","20":"and about the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn that came up and before which three of them fell, the horn that had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and that seemed greater than its companions.","21":"As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them,","22":"until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.","23":"\"Thus he said: 'As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to pieces.","24":"As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise, and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the former ones, and shall put down three kings.","25":"He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.","26":"But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end.","27":"And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.'","28":"\"Here is the end of the matter.

It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.","4":"I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.","5":"As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.","6":"He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran at him in his powerful wrath.","7":"I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power.","8":"Then the goat became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.","9":"Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land.","10":"It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them.","11":"It became great, even as great as the Prince of the host.

Then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful state.\"","15":"When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.","16":"And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, \"Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.\"","17":"So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, \"Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.\"","18":"And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up.","19":"He said, \"Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end.","20":"As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia.","21":"And the goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king.","22":"As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power.","23":"And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise.","24":"His power shall be great--but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints.","25":"By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great. Without warning he shall destroy many.

How then will you understand all the parables?","14":"The sower sows the word.","15":"And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them.","16":"And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.","17":"And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.","18":"And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word,","19":"but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.","20":"But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.\"","21":"And he said to them, \"Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand?","22":"For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light.","23":"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\"","24":"And he said to them, \"Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you.","25":"For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.\"","26":"And he said, \"The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground.","27":"He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he knows not how.","28":"The earth produces by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.","29":"But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.\"","30":"And he said, \"With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?","31":"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth,","32":"yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.\"","33":"With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.","34":"He did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.","35":"On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, \"Let us go across to the other side.\"","36":"And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was.

And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the pigs, and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea.","14":"The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened.","15":"And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.","16":"And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.","17":"And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region.","18":"As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him.","19":"And he did not permit him but said to him, \"Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\"","20":"And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.","21":"And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea.","22":"Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet","23":"and implored him earnestly, saying, \"My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.\"","24":"And he went with him.And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.","25":"And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years,","26":"and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse.","27":"She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.","28":"For she said, \"If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.\"","29":"And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.","30":"And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, \"Who touched my garments?\"","31":"And his disciples said to him, \"You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, 'Who touched me?'\"","32":"And he looked around to see who had done it.","33":"But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.","34":"And he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.\"","35":"While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, \"Your daughter is dead.

But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of testing fall away.","14":"And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.","15":"As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with patience.","16":"\"No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.","17":"For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.","18":"Take care then how you hear, for to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.\"","19":"Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.","20":"And he was told, \"Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.\"","21":"But he answered them, \"My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\"","22":"One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, \"Let us go across to the other side of the lake.\" So they set out,","23":"and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger.","24":"And they went and woke him, saying, \"Master, Master, we are perishing!\" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm.","25":"He said to them, \"Where is your faith?\" And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, \"Who then is this, that he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?\"","26":"Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.","27":"When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the tombs.","28":"When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.\"","29":"For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.)","30":"Jesus then asked him, \"What is your name?\" And he said, \"Legion,\" for many demons had entered him.","31":"And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss.","32":"Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission.","33":"Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.","34":"When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.","35":"Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.","36":"And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.","37":"Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.","38":"The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,","39":"\"Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.\" And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.","40":"Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.","41":"And there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus' feet, he implored him to come to his house,","42":"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.As Jesus went, the people pressed around him.","43":"And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her living on physicians, she could not be healed by anyone.","44":"She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her discharge of blood ceased.","45":"And Jesus said, \"Who was it that touched me?\" When all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!\"","46":"But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me, for I perceive that power has gone out from me.\"","47":"And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.","48":"And he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.\"","49":"While he was still speaking, someone from the ruler's house came and said, \"Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.\"","50":"But Jesus on hearing this answered him, \"Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well.\"","51":"And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child.","52":"And all were weeping and mourning for her, but he said, \"Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping.\"","53":"And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.","54":"But taking her by the hand he called, saying, \"Child, arise.\"","55":"And her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat.","56":"And her parents were amazed, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened."},"9":{"1":"And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases,","2":"and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal.","3":"And he said to them, \"Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.","4":"And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.","5":"And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.\"","6":"And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.","7":"Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,","8":"by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen.","9":"Herod said, \"John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?\" And he sought to see him.","10":"On their return the apostles told him all that they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida.","11":"When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing.","12":"Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, \"Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.\"","13":"But he said to them, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said, \"We have no more than five loaves and two fish--unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.\"","14":"For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, \"Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\"","15":"And they did so, and had them all sit down.","16":"And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.","17":"And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of broken pieces.","18":"Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, \"Who do the crowds say that I am?\"","19":"And they answered, \"John the Baptist. But others say, Elijah, and others, that one of the prophets of old has risen.\"","20":"Then he said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\" And Peter answered, \"The Christ of God.\"","21":"And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one,","22":"saying, \"The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.\"","23":"And he said to all, \"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.","24":"For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.","25":"For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?","26":"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.","27":"But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.\"","28":"Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.","29":"And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white.","30":"And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah,","31":"who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.","32":"Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.","33":"And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, \"Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah\"--not knowing what he said.","34":"As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.","35":"And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, \"This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!\"","36":"And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.","37":"On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.","38":"And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, \"Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.","39":"And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth; and shatters him, and will hardly leave him.","40":"And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.\"","41":"Jesus answered, \"O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.\"","42":"While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.","43":"And all were astonished at the majesty of God.But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples,","44":"\"Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.\"","45":"But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they might not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.","46":"An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.","47":"But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side","48":"and said to them, \"Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.\"","49":"John answered, \"Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us.\"","50":"But Jesus said to him, \"Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you.\"","51":"When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.","52":"And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make preparations for him.","53":"But the people did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem.","54":"And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, \"Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?\"","55":"But he turned and rebuked them.","56":"And they went on to another village.","57":"As they were going along the road, someone said to him, \"I will follow you wherever you go.\"","58":"And Jesus said to him, \"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.\"","59":"To another he said, \"Follow me.\" But he said, \"Lord, let me first go and bury my father.\"","60":"And Jesus said to him, \"Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.\"","61":"Yet another said, \"I will follow you, Lord, but let me first say farewell to those at my home.\"","62":"Jesus said to him, \"No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.\""},"10":{"1":"After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go.","2":"And he said to them, \"The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.","3":"Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.","4":"Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and greet no one on the road.","5":"Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house!'","6":"And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you.","7":"And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house.","8":"Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you.","9":"Heal the sick in it and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'","10":"But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,","11":"'Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.'","12":"I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.","13":"\"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.","14":"But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.","15":"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades.","16":"\"The one who hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\"","17":"The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, \"Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!\"","18":"And he said to them, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.","19":"Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.","20":"Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\"","21":"In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, \"I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.","22":"All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, or who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\"","23":"Then turning to the disciples he said privately, \"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!","24":"For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.\"","25":"And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, \"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\"","26":"He said to him, \"What is written in the Law? How do you read it?\"","27":"And he answered, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.\"","28":"And he said to him, \"You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.\"","29":"But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\"","30":"Jesus replied, \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead.","31":"Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.","32":"So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.","33":"But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion.","34":"He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.","35":"And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.'","36":"Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?\"","37":"He said, \"The one who showed him mercy.\" And Jesus said to him, \"You go, and do likewise.\"","38":"Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.","39":"And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.","40":"But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she went up to him and said, \"Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?

Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.\""},"11":{"1":"Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, \"Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.\"","2":"And he said to them, \"When you pray, say: \"Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come.","3":"Give us each day our daily bread,","4":"and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us.

I cannot get up and give you anything'?","8":"I tell you, though he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his impudence he will rise and give him whatever he needs.","9":"And I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.","10":"For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.","11":"What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent;","12":"or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?","13":"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\"","14":"Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke, and the people marveled.","15":"But some of them said, \"He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons,\"","16":"while others, to test him, kept seeking from him a sign from heaven.","17":"But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a divided household falls.","18":"And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?

Untie it and bring it here.","31":"If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say this: 'The Lord has need of it.'\"","32":"So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.","33":"And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, \"Why are you untying the colt?\"","34":"And they said, \"The Lord has need of it.\"","35":"And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it.","36":"And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road.","37":"As he was drawing near--already on the way down the Mount of Olives--the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,","38":"saying, \"Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!\"","39":"And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, \"Teacher, rebuke your disciples.\"","40":"He answered, \"I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.\"","41":"And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it,","42":"saying, \"Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace!

I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.'","14":"But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'","15":"And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?","16":"He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\" When they heard this, they said, \"Surely not!\"","17":"But he looked directly at them and said, \"What then is this that is written: \"'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?","18":"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.\"","19":"The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people.","20":"So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor.","21":"So they asked him, \"Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God.","22":"Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?\"","23":"But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,","24":"\"Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?\" They said, \"Caesar's.\"","25":"He said to them, \"Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\"","26":"And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.","27":"There came to him some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection,","28":"and they asked him a question, saying, \"Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.","29":"Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children.","30":"And the second","31":"and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died.","32":"Afterward the woman also died.","33":"In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be?

The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.","64":"But there are some of you who do not believe.\" (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.)","65":"And he said, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.\"","66":"After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him.","67":"So Jesus said to the Twelve, \"Do you want to go away as well?\"","68":"Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,","69":"and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.\"","70":"Jesus answered them, \"Did I not choose you, the Twelve? And yet one of you is a devil.\"","71":"He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray him."},"7":{"1":"After this Jesus went about in Galilee. He would not go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.","2":"Now the Jews' Feast of Booths was at hand.","3":"So his brothers said to him, \"Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing.","4":"For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.\"","5":"For not even his brothers believed in him.","6":"Jesus said to them, \"My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.","7":"The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its works are evil.","8":"You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.\"","9":"After saying this, he remained in Galilee.","10":"But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private.","11":"The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, \"Where is he?\"","12":"And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, \"He is a good man,\" others said, \"No, he is leading the people astray.\"","13":"Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.","14":"About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching.","15":"The Jews therefore marveled, saying, \"How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?\"","16":"So Jesus answered them, \"My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.","17":"If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.","18":"The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.","19":"Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?\"","20":"The crowd answered, \"You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?\"","21":"Jesus answered them, \"I did one deed, and you all marvel at it.","22":"Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.","23":"If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?","24":"Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.\"","25":"Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, \"Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?","26":"And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?","27":"But we know where this man comes from, and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.\"","28":"So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, \"You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord. He who sent me is true, and him you do not know.","29":"I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.\"","30":"So they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.","31":"Yet many of the people believed in him. They said, \"When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?\"","32":"The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.","33":"Jesus then said, \"I will be with you a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.","34":"You will seek me and you will not find me. Where I am you cannot come.\"","35":"The Jews said to one another, \"Where does this man intend to go that we will not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?","36":"What does he mean by saying, 'You will seek me and you will not find me,' and, 'Where I am you cannot come'?\"","37":"On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, \"If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.","38":"Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.'\"","39":"Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.","40":"When they heard these words, some of the people said, \"This really is the Prophet.\"","41":"Others said, \"This is the Christ.\" But some said, \"Is the Christ to come from Galilee?","42":"Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the offspring of David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?\"","43":"So there was a division among the people over him.","44":"Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.","45":"The officers then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, \"Why did you not bring him?\"","46":"The officers answered, \"No one ever spoke like this man!\"","47":"The Pharisees answered them, \"Have you also been deceived?","48":"Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him?","49":"But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.\"","50":"Nicodemus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them,","51":"\"Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?\"","52":"They replied, \"Are you from Galilee too?

So what do you say?\"","6":"This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.","7":"And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, \"Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.\"","8":"And once more he bent down and wrote on the ground.","9":"But when they heard it, they went away one by one, beginning with the older ones, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.","10":"Jesus stood up and said to her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\"","11":"She said, \"No one, Lord.\" And Jesus said, \"Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.\"]]","12":"Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\"","13":"So the Pharisees said to him, \"You are bearing witness about yourself; your testimony is not true.\"","14":"Jesus answered, \"Even if I do bear witness about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.","15":"You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.","16":"Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone who judge, but I and the Father who sent me.","17":"In your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.","18":"I am the one who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me.\"","19":"They said to him therefore, \"Where is your Father?\" Jesus answered, \"You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\"","20":"These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.","21":"So he said to them again, \"I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.\"","22":"So the Jews said, \"Will he kill himself, since he says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?\"","23":"He said to them, \"You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.","24":"I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins.\"","25":"So they said to him, \"Who are you?\" Jesus said to them, \"Just what I have been telling you from the beginning.","26":"I have much to say about you and much to judge, but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\"","27":"They did not understand that he had been speaking to them about the Father.","28":"So Jesus said to them, \"When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority, but speak just as the Father taught me.","29":"And he who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.\"","30":"As he was saying these things, many believed in him.","31":"So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, \"If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,","32":"and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\"","33":"They answered him, \"We are offspring of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say, 'You will become free'?\"","34":"Jesus answered them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin.","35":"The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.","36":"So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.","37":"I know that you are offspring of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you.","38":"I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.\"","39":"They answered him, \"Abraham is our father.\" Jesus said to them, \"If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing what Abraham did,","40":"but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.","41":"You are doing what your father did.\" They said to him, \"We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father--even God.\"","42":"Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but He sent me.","43":"Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.","44":"You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.","45":"But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.","46":"Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?","47":"Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.\"","48":"The Jews answered him, \"Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?\"","49":"Jesus answered, \"I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.","50":"Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge.","51":"Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.\"","52":"The Jews said to him, \"Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.'","53":"Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?\"","54":"Jesus answered, \"If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, 'He is our God.'","55":"But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word.","56":"Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.\"","57":"So the Jews said to him, \"You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?\"","58":"Jesus said to them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.\"","59":"So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple."},"9":{"1":"As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.","2":"And his disciples asked him, \"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\"","3":"Jesus answered, \"It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.","4":"We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.","5":"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\"","6":"Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud","7":"and said to him, \"Go, wash in the pool of Siloam\" (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.","8":"The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, \"Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?\"","9":"Some said, \"It is he.\" Others said, \"No, but he is like him.\" He kept saying, \"I am the man.\"","10":"So they said to him, \"Then how were your eyes opened?\"","11":"He answered, \"The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went and washed and received my sight.\"","12":"They said to him, \"Where is he?\" He said, \"I do not know.\"","13":"They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.","14":"Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.","15":"So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, \"He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.\"","16":"Some of the Pharisees said, \"This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.\" But others said, \"How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?\" And there was a division among them.","17":"So they said again to the blind man, \"What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?\" He said, \"He is a prophet.\"","18":"The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight","19":"and asked them, \"Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?\"","20":"His parents answered, \"We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.","21":"But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.\"","22":"(His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.)","23":"Therefore his parents said, \"He is of age; ask him.\"","24":"So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, \"Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.\"","25":"He answered, \"Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.\"","26":"They said to him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\"","27":"He answered them, \"I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?\"","28":"And they reviled him, saying, \"You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.","29":"We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.\"","30":"The man answered, \"Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.","31":"We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.","32":"Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.","33":"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\"","34":"They answered him, \"You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?\" And they cast him out.","35":"Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\"","36":"He answered, \"And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?\"","37":"Jesus said to him, \"You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.\"","38":"He said, \"Lord, I believe,\" and he worshiped him.","39":"Jesus said, \"For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.\"","40":"Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, \"Are we also blind?\"","41":"Jesus said to them, \"If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, 'We see,' your guilt remains."},"10":{"1":"\"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber.","2":"But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.","3":"To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.","4":"When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.","5":"A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.\"","6":"This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.","7":"So Jesus again said to them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.","8":"All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.","9":"I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.","10":"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.","11":"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.","12":"He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.","13":"He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.","14":"I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,","15":"just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.","16":"And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.","17":"For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.","18":"No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.\"","19":"There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.","20":"Many of them said, \"He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?\"","21":"Others said, \"These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\"","22":"At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter,","23":"and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon.","24":"So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, \"How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.\"","25":"Jesus answered them, \"I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,","26":"but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock.","27":"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.","28":"I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.","29":"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.","30":"I and the Father are one.\"","31":"The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.","32":"Jesus answered them, \"I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?\"","33":"The Jews answered him, \"It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.\"","34":"Jesus answered them, \"Is it not written in your Law, 'I said, you are gods'?","35":"If he called them gods to whom the word of God came--and Scripture cannot be broken--","36":"do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?","37":"If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;","38":"but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\"","39":"Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.","40":"He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained.","41":"And many came to him.

It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.\"","5":"Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.","6":"So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.","7":"Then after this he said to the disciples, \"Let us go to Judea again.\"","8":"The disciples said to him, \"Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?\"","9":"Jesus answered, \"Are there not twelve hours in the day?

Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,","26":"and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?\"","27":"She said to him, \"Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.\"","28":"When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, \"The Teacher is here and is calling for you.\"","29":"And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.","30":"Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.","31":"When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.","32":"Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\"","33":"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled.","34":"And he said, \"Where have you laid him?\" They said to him, \"Lord, come and see.\"","35":"Jesus wept.","36":"So the Jews said, \"See how he loved him!\"","37":"But some of them said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?\"","38":"Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.","39":"Jesus said, \"Take away the stone.\" Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, \"Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.\"","40":"Jesus said to her, \"Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?\"","41":"So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me.","42":"I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.\"","43":"When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out.\"","44":"The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, \"Unbind him, and let him go.\"","45":"Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him,","46":"but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.","47":"So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Council and said, \"What are we to do?

Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.\"","13":"So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha.","14":"Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, \"Behold your King!\"","15":"They cried out, \"Away with him, away with him, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Shall I crucify your King?\" The chief priests answered,.We have no king but Caesar.\"","16":"So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.So they took Jesus,","17":"and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the place of a skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha.","18":"There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.","19":"Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.\"","20":"Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.","21":"So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, \"Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but rather, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.'\"","22":"Pilate answered, \"What I have written I have written.\"","23":"When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom,","24":"so they said to one another, \"Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.\" This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, \"They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.\"So the soldiers did these things,","25":"but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.","26":"When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, \"Woman, behold, your son!\"","27":"Then he said to the disciple, \"Behold, your mother!\" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.","28":"After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), \"I thirst.\"","29":"A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.","30":"When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, \"It is finished,\" and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","31":"Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.","32":"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him.","33":"But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.","34":"But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.","35":"He who saw it has borne witness--his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth--that you also may believe.","36":"For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: \"Not one of his bones will be broken.\"","37":"And again another Scripture says, \"They will look on him whom they have pierced.\"","38":"After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.","39":"Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight.","40":"So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.","41":"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.","42":"So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there."},"20":{"1":"Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.","2":"So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, \"They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.\"","3":"So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.","4":"Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.","5":"And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.","6":"Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there,","7":"and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself.","8":"Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed;","9":"for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.","10":"Then the disciples went back to their homes.","11":"But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.","12":"And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet.","13":"They said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping?\" She said to them, \"They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.\"","14":"Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.","15":"Jesus said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?\" Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, \"Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.\"","16":"Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned and said to him in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher).","17":"Jesus said to her, \"Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'\"","18":"Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, \"I have seen the Lord\"--and that he had said these things to her.","19":"On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\"","20":"When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.","21":"Jesus said to them again, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.\"","22":"And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, \"Receive the Holy Spirit.","23":"If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.\"","24":"Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.","25":"So the other disciples told him, \"We have seen the Lord.\" But he said to them, \"Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.\"","26":"Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you.\"","27":"Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.\"","28":"Thomas answered him, \"My Lord and my God!\"","29":"Jesus said to him, \"Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\"","30":"Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;","31":"but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."},"21":{"1":"After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way.","2":"Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.","3":"Simon Peter said to them, \"I am going fishing.\" They said to him, \"We will go with you.\" They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.","4":"Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.","5":"Jesus said to them, \"Children, do you have any fish?\" They answered him, \"No.\"","6":"He said to them, \"Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.\" So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish.","7":"That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, \"It is the Lord!\" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea.","8":"The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.","9":"When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread.","10":"Jesus said to them, \"Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.\"","11":"So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn.","12":"Jesus said to them, \"Come and have breakfast.\" Now none of the disciples dared ask him, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord.","13":"Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish.","14":"This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.","15":"When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?\" He said to him, \"Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him, \"Feed my lambs.\"","16":"He said to him a second time, \"Simon, son of John, do you love me?\" He said to him, \"Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him, \"Tend my sheep.\"","17":"He said to him the third time, \"Simon, son of John, do you love me?\" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, \"Do you love me?\" and he said to him, \"Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\" Jesus said to him, \"Feed my sheep.","18":"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.\"","19":"(This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, \"Follow me.\"","20":"Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had been reclining at table close to him and had said, \"Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?\"","21":"When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, \"Lord, what about this man?\"","22":"Jesus said to him, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!\"","23":"So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, \"If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?\"","24":"This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.","25":"Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written."}},"Acts":{"1":{"1":"In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach,","2":"until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.","3":"To them he presented himself alive after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.","4":"And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, \"you heard from me;","5":"for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.\"","6":"So when they had come together, they asked him, \"Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?\"","7":"He said to them, \"It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.","8":"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.\"","9":"And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.","10":"And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,","11":"and said, \"Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.\"","12":"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.","13":"And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.","14":"All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.","15":"In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said,","16":"\"Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.","17":"For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.\"","18":"(Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.","19":"And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)","20":"\"For it is written in the Book of Psalms, \"'May his camp become desolate, and let there be no one to dwell in it';and \"'Let another take his office.'","21":"So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,","22":"beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us--one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.\"","23":"And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.","24":"And they prayed and said, \"You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen","25":"to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.\"","26":"And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."},"2":{"1":"When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.","2":"And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.","3":"And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.","4":"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.","5":"Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.","6":"And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language.","7":"And they were amazed and astonished, saying, \"Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?","8":"And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language?","9":"Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,","10":"Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,","11":"both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians--we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.\"","12":"And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, \"What does this mean?\"","13":"But others mocking said, \"They are filled with new wine.\"","14":"But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, \"Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.","15":"For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.","16":"But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:","17":"\"'And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;","18":"even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.","19":"And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;","20":"the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.","21":"And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'","22":"\"Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know--","23":"this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.","24":"God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.","25":"For David says concerning him, \"'I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;","26":"therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope.","27":"For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption.","28":"You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.'","29":"\"Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.","30":"Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,","31":"he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.","32":"This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.","33":"Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.","34":"For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, \"'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,","35":"until I make your enemies your footstool.'","36":"Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.\"","37":"Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\"","38":"And Peter said to them, \"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.","39":"For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.\"","40":"And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, \"Save yourselves from this crooked generation.\"","41":"So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.","42":"And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.","43":"And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.","44":"And all who believed were together and had all things in common.","45":"And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.","46":"And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,","47":"praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved."},"3":{"1":"Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.","2":"And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple.","3":"Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms.","4":"And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, \"Look at us.\"","5":"And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.","6":"But Peter said, \"I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!\"","7":"And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.","8":"And leaping up he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.","9":"And all the people saw him walking and praising God,","10":"and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.","11":"While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's, astounded.","12":"And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: \"Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk?","13":"The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.","14":"But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,","15":"and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.","16":"And his name--by faith in his name--has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.","17":"\"And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.","18":"But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled.","19":"Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out,","20":"that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus,","21":"whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago.","22":"Moses said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.","23":"And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.'","24":"And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days.","25":"You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'","26":"God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.\""},"4":{"1":"And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,","2":"greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.","3":"And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.","4":"But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.","5":"On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem,","6":"with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family.","7":"And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, \"By what power or by what name did you do this?\"","8":"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, \"Rulers of the people and elders,","9":"if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,","10":"let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead--by him this man is standing before you well.","11":"This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.","12":"And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\"","13":"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.","14":"But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.","15":"But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another,","16":"saying, \"What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.","17":"But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.\"","18":"So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.","19":"But Peter and John answered them, \"Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge,","20":"for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.\"","21":"And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened.","22":"For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.","23":"When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.","24":"And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, \"Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,","25":"who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit, \"'Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot in vain?","26":"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed'--","27":"for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,","28":"to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.","29":"And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness,","30":"while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.\"","31":"And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.","32":"Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.","33":"And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.","34":"There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold","35":"and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.","36":"Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,","37":"sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet."},"5":{"1":"But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,","2":"and with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet.","3":"But Peter said, \"Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?","4":"While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.\"","5":"When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last.

When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.","11":"And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.","12":"Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico.","13":"None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high esteem.","14":"And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,","15":"so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them.","16":"The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.","17":"But the high priest rose up, and all who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and filled with jealousy","18":"they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison.","19":"But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,","20":"\"Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.\"","21":"And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.Now when the high priest came, and those who were with him, they called together the council and all the senate of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought.","22":"But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported,","23":"\"We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them we found no one inside.\"","24":"Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to.","25":"And someone came and told them, \"Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.\"","26":"Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but not by force, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.","27":"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them,","28":"saying, \"We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us.\"","29":"But Peter and the apostles answered, \"We must obey God rather than men.","30":"The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.","31":"God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.","32":"And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.\"","33":"When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.","34":"But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while.","35":"And he said to them, \"Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men.","36":"For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.","37":"After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered.","38":"So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or this undertaking is of man, it will fail;","39":"but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!\" So they took his advice,","40":"and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.","41":"Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name.","42":"And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ."},"6":{"1":"Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.","2":"And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, \"It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables.","3":"Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty.","4":"But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.\"","5":"And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch.","6":"These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them.","7":"And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.","8":"And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.","9":"Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen.","10":"But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.","11":"Then they secretly instigated men who said, \"We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.\"","12":"And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council,","13":"and they set up false witnesses who said, \"This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law,","14":"for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us.\"","15":"And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel."},"7":{"1":"And the high priest said, \"Are these things so?\"","2":"And Stephen said:\"Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,","3":"and said to him, 'Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.'","4":"Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living.","5":"Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child.","6":"And God spoke to this effect--that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years.","7":"'But I will judge the nation that they serve,' said God, 'and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.'","8":"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.","9":"\"And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him","10":"and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household.","11":"Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food.","12":"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit.","13":"And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.","14":"And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all.","15":"And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers,","16":"and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.","17":"\"But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt","18":"until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph.","19":"He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive.","20":"At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God's sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house,","21":"and when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.","22":"And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.","23":"\"When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.","24":"And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian.","25":"He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand.","26":"And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, 'Men, you are brothers. Why do you wrong each other?'","27":"But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?","28":"Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'","29":"At this retort Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.","30":"\"Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.","31":"When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and as he drew near to look, there came the voice of the Lord:","32":"'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.' And Moses trembled and did not dare to look.","33":"Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.","34":"I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.'","35":"\"This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.","36":"This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.","37":"This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.'","38":"This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us.","39":"Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt,","40":"saying to Aaron, 'Make for us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'","41":"And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.","42":"But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: \"'Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices, during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?","43":"You took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship; and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.'","44":"\"Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen.","45":"Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David,","46":"who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.","47":"But it was Solomon who built a house for him.","48":"Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands, as the prophet says,","49":"\"'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?","50":"Did not my hand make all these things?'","51":"\"You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you.","52":"Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered,","53":"you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it.\"","54":"Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth at him.","55":"But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.","56":"And he said, \"Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.\"","57":"But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together at him.","58":"Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.","59":"And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\"","60":"And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, \"Lord, do not hold this sin against them.\" And when he had said this, he fell asleep."},"8":{"1":"And Saul approved of his execution.And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.","2":"Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.","3":"But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.","4":"Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word.","5":"Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.","6":"And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip when they heard him and saw the signs that he did.","7":"For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.","8":"So there was much joy in that city.","9":"But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great.","10":"They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, \"This man is the power of God that is called Great.\"","11":"And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.","12":"But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.","13":"Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.","14":"Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,","15":"who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,","16":"for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.","17":"Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.","18":"Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,","19":"saying, \"Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.\"","20":"But Peter said to him, \"May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!","21":"You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.","22":"Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.","23":"For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.\"","24":"And Simon answered, \"Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.\"","25":"Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.","26":"Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, \"Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.\" This is a desert place.","27":"And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship","28":"and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.","29":"And the Spirit said to Philip, \"Go over and join this chariot.\"","30":"So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, \"Do you understand what you are reading?\"","31":"And he said, \"How can I, unless someone guides me?\" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.","32":"Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: \"Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he opens not his mouth.","33":"In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth.\"","34":"And the eunuch said to Philip, \"About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?\"","35":"Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus.","36":"And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, \"See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?\"","37":"See Footnote","38":"And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.","39":"And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.","40":"But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea."},"9":{"1":"But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest","2":"and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.","3":"Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.","4":"And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, \"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?\"","5":"And he said, \"Who are you, Lord?\" And he said, \"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.","6":"But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.\"","7":"The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.","8":"Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.","9":"And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.","10":"Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, \"Ananias.\" And he said, \"Here I am, Lord.\"","11":"And the Lord said to him, \"Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,","12":"and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.\"","13":"But Ananias answered, \"Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem.","14":"And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.\"","15":"But the Lord said to him, \"Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.","16":"For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.\"","17":"So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, \"Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.\"","18":"And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized;","19":"and taking food, he was strengthened.For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus.","20":"And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, \"He is the Son of God.\"","21":"And all who heard him were amazed and said, \"Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?\"","22":"But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.","23":"When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,","24":"but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him,","25":"but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.","26":"And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.","27":"But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.","28":"So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord.","29":"And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him.","30":"And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.","31":"So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied.","32":"Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.","33":"There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed.","34":"And Peter said to him, \"Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.\" And immediately he rose.","35":"And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.","36":"Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity.","37":"In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.","38":"Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, \"Please come to us without delay.\"","39":"So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.","40":"But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, \"Tabitha, arise.\" And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.","41":"And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.","42":"And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.","43":"And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner."},"10":{"1":"At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,","2":"a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God.","3":"About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, \"Cornelius.\"","4":"And he stared at him in terror and said, \"What is it, Lord?\" And he said to him, \"Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.","5":"And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter.","6":"He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.\"","7":"When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him,","8":"and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.","9":"The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.","10":"And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance","11":"and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth.","12":"In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.","13":"And there came a voice to him: \"Rise, Peter; kill and eat.\"","14":"But Peter said, \"By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.\"","15":"And the voice came to him again a second time, \"What God has made clean, do not call common.\"","16":"This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.","17":"Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate","18":"and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.","19":"And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, \"Behold, three men are looking for you.","20":"Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them.\"","21":"And Peter went down to the men and said, \"I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?\"","22":"And they said, \"Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say.\"","23":"So he invited them in to be his guests.The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.","24":"And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.","25":"When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him.","26":"But Peter lifted him up, saying, \"Stand up; I too am a man.\"","27":"And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered.","28":"And he said to them, \"You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.","29":"So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me.\"","30":"And Cornelius said, \"Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing","31":"and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.","32":"Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.'","33":"So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.\"","34":"So Peter opened his mouth and said: \"Truly I understand that God shows no partiality,","35":"but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.","36":"As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),","37":"you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed:","38":"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.","39":"And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree,","40":"but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear,","41":"not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.","42":"And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.","43":"To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\"","44":"While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.","45":"And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles.","46":"For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared,","47":"\"Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?\"","48":"And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days."},"11":{"1":"Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.","2":"So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying,","3":"\"You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.\"","4":"But Peter began and explained it to them in order:","5":"\"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me.","6":"Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air.","7":"And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'","8":"But I said, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'","9":"But the voice answered a second time from heaven, 'What God has made clean, do not call common.'","10":"This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.","11":"And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea.","12":"And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.","13":"And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter;","14":"he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'","15":"As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning.","16":"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'","17":"If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?\"","18":"When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, \"Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.\"","19":"Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.","20":"But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus.","21":"And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.","22":"The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.","23":"When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose,","24":"for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.","25":"So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,","26":"and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.","27":"Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.","28":"And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius).","29":"So the disciples determined, everyone according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.","30":"And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul."},"12":{"1":"About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church.","2":"He killed James the brother of John with the sword,","3":"and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread.","4":"And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.","5":"So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.","6":"Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.","7":"And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, \"Get up quickly.\" And the chains fell off his hands.","8":"And the angel said to him, \"Dress yourself and put on your sandals.\" And he did so. And he said to him, \"Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.\"","9":"And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.","10":"When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him.","11":"When Peter came to himself, he said, \"Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.\"","12":"When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.","13":"And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.","14":"Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate.","15":"They said to her, \"You are out of your mind.\" But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, \"It is his angel!\"","16":"But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed.","17":"But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, \"Tell these things to James and to the brothers.\" Then he departed and went to another place.","18":"Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.","19":"And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.","20":"Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.","21":"On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them.","22":"And the people were shouting, \"The voice of a god, and not of a man!\"","23":"Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.","24":"But the word of God increased and multiplied.","25":"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them John, whose other name was Mark."},"13":{"1":"Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.","2":"While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, \"Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.\"","3":"Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.","4":"So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.","5":"When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them.","6":"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus.","7":"He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.","8":"But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.","9":"But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him","10":"and said, \"You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?","11":"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.\" Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand.","12":"Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.","13":"Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem,","14":"but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.","15":"After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, \"Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.\"","16":"So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:\"Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen.","17":"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.","18":"And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.","19":"And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance.","20":"All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.","21":"Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.","22":"And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, 'I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'","23":"Of this man's offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.","24":"Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.","25":"And as John was finishing his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'","26":"\"Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.","27":"For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.","28":"And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.","29":"And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.","30":"But God raised him from the dead,","31":"and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.","32":"And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,","33":"this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, \"'You are my Son, today I have begotten you.'","34":"And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, \"'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'","35":"Therefore he says also in another psalm, \"'You will not let your Holy One see corruption.'","36":"For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption,","37":"but he whom God raised up did not see corruption.","38":"Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything","39":"from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.","40":"Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:","41":"\"'Look, you scoffers, be astounded and perish; for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.'\"","42":"As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath.","43":"And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.","44":"The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.","45":"But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him.","46":"And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, \"It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.","47":"For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, \"'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'\"","48":"And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.","49":"And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region.","50":"But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.","51":"But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.","52":"And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit."},"14":{"1":"Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.","2":"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.","3":"So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.","4":"But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles.","5":"When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them,","6":"they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country,","7":"and there they continued to preach the gospel.","8":"Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was crippled from birth and had never walked.","9":"He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,","10":"said in a loud voice, \"Stand upright on your feet.\" And he sprang up and began walking.","11":"And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, \"The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!\"","12":"Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.","13":"And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.","14":"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out,","15":"\"Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.","16":"In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.","17":"Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.\"","18":"Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.","19":"But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.","20":"But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.","21":"When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,","22":"strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.","23":"And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.","24":"Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.","25":"And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia,","26":"and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled.","27":"And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.","28":"And they remained no little time with the disciples."},"15":{"1":"But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, \"Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.\"","2":"And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question.","3":"So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers.","4":"When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them.","5":"But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, \"It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses.\"","6":"The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.","7":"And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, \"Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.","8":"And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us,","9":"and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith.","10":"Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?","11":"But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.\"","12":"And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.","13":"After they finished speaking, James replied, \"Brothers, listen to me.","14":"Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name.","15":"And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,","16":"\"'After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it,","17":"that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things","18":"known from of old.'","19":"Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God,","20":"but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.","21":"For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.\"","22":"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,","23":"with the following letter: \"The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings.","24":"Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,","25":"it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,","26":"men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.","27":"We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.","28":"For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements:","29":"that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.\"","30":"So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.","31":"And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.","32":"And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words.","33":"And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.","34":"See Footnote","35":"But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.","36":"And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, \"Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.\"","37":"Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark.","38":"But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.","39":"And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,","40":"but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.","41":"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."},"16":{"1":"Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.","2":"He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.","3":"Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.","4":"As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.","5":"So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.","6":"And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.","7":"And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.","8":"So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.","9":"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, \"Come over to Macedonia and help us.\"","10":"And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.","11":"So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis,","12":"and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days.","13":"And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.","14":"One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.","15":"And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, \"If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.\" And she prevailed upon us.","16":"As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling.","17":"She followed Paul and us, crying out, \"These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.\"","18":"And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, \"I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.\" And it came out that very hour.","19":"But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.","20":"And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, \"These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city.","21":"They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice.\"","22":"The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods.","23":"And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.","24":"Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.","25":"About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,","26":"and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were unfastened.","27":"When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.","28":"But Paul cried with a loud voice, \"Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.\"","29":"And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas.","30":"Then he brought them out and said, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\"","31":"And they said, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.\"","32":"And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.","33":"And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family.","34":"Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.","35":"But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, \"Let those men go.\"","36":"And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, \"The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace.\"","37":"But Paul said to them, \"They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.\"","38":"The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.","39":"So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city.","40":"So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed."},"17":{"1":"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.","2":"And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,","3":"explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, \"This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.\"","4":"And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women.","5":"But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd.","6":"And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, \"These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,","7":"and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.\"","8":"And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things.","9":"And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.","10":"The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue.","11":"Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.","12":"Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men.","13":"But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds.","14":"Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there.","15":"Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.","16":"Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.","17":"So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.","18":"Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, \"What does this babbler wish to say?\" Others said, \"He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities\"--because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.","19":"And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, \"May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?","20":"For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.\"","21":"Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.","22":"So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: \"Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.","23":"For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, 'To the unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.","24":"The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man,","25":"nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.","26":"And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place,","27":"that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,","28":"for \"'In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your own poets have said, \"'For we are indeed his offspring.'","29":"Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.","30":"The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,","31":"because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.\"","32":"Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, \"We will hear you again about this.\"","33":"So Paul went out from their midst.","34":"But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them."},"18":{"1":"After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.","2":"And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them,","3":"and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.","4":"And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks.","5":"When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus.","6":"And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, \"Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.\"","7":"And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue.","8":"Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized.","9":"And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, \"Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,","10":"for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people.\"","11":"And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.","12":"But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal,","13":"saying, \"This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law.\"","14":"But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, \"If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint.","15":"But since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things.\"","16":"And he drove them from the tribunal.","17":"And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.","18":"After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow.","19":"And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.","20":"When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined.","21":"But on taking leave of them he said, \"I will return to you if God wills,\" and he set sail from Ephesus.","22":"When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.","23":"After spending some time there, he departed and went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.","24":"Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures.","25":"He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.","26":"He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately.","27":"And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed,","28":"for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus."},"19":{"1":"And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.","2":"And he said to them, \"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\" And they said, \"No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\"","3":"And he said, \"Into what then were you baptized?\" They said, \"Into John's baptism.\"","4":"And Paul said, \"John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.\"","5":"On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.","6":"And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.","7":"There were about twelve men in all.","8":"And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.","9":"But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus.","10":"This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.","11":"And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,","12":"so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.","13":"Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, \"I adjure you by the Jesus, whom Paul proclaims.\"","14":"Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.","15":"But the evil spirit answered them, \"Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?\"","16":"And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.","17":"And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled.","18":"Also many of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices.","19":"And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.","20":"So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily.","21":"Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, \"After I have been there, I must also see Rome.\"","22":"And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.","23":"About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way.","24":"For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen.","25":"These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, \"Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.","26":"And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.","27":"And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship.\"","28":"When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\"","29":"So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's companions in travel.","30":"But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him.","31":"And even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater.","32":"Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.","33":"Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.","34":"But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\"","35":"And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, \"Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky?","36":"Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.","37":"For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess.","38":"If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.","39":"But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.","40":"For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion.\"","41":"And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly."},"20":{"1":"After the uproar ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging them, he said farewell and departed for Macedonia.","2":"When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.","3":"There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.","4":"Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus from Berea, accompanied him; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.","5":"These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas,","6":"but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them at Troas, where we stayed for seven days.","7":"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight.","8":"There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered.","9":"And a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer. And being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.","10":"But Paul went down and bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said, \"Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.\"","11":"And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed.","12":"And they took the youth away alive, and were not a little comforted.","13":"But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.","14":"And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.","15":"And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we went to Miletus.","16":"For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.","17":"Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him.","18":"And when they came to him, he said to them:\"You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia,","19":"serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews;","20":"how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,","21":"testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.","22":"And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,","23":"except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.","24":"But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.","25":"And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again.","26":"Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you,","27":"for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.","28":"Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood.","29":"I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;","30":"and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them.","31":"Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears.","32":"And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.","33":"I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.","34":"You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me.","35":"In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'\"","36":"And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.","37":"And there was much weeping on the part of all; they embraced Paul and kissed him,","38":"being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship."},"21":{"1":"And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.","2":"And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.","3":"When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload its cargo.","4":"And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.","5":"When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed","6":"and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.","7":"When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day.","8":"On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.","9":"He had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied.","10":"While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.","11":"And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, \"Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'\"","12":"When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.","13":"Then Paul answered, \"What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\"","14":"And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, \"Let the will of the Lord be done.\"","15":"After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.","16":"And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.","17":"When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.","18":"On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.","19":"After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.","20":"And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, \"You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law,","21":"and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs.","22":"What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.","23":"Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;","24":"take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law.","25":"But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.\"","26":"Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them.","27":"When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,","28":"crying out, \"Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.\"","29":"For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.","30":"Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut.","31":"And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.","32":"He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.","33":"Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.","34":"Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.","35":"And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,","36":"for the mob of the people followed, crying out, \"Away with him!\"","37":"As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, \"May I say something to you?\" And he said, \"Do you know Greek?","38":"Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?\"","39":"Paul replied, \"I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.\"","40":"And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:"},"22":{"1":"\"Brothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you.\"","2":"And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even more quiet. And he said:","3":"\"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day.","4":"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,","5":"as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.","6":"\"As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me.","7":"And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'","8":"And I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'","9":"Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.","10":"And I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.'","11":"And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.","12":"\"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,","13":"came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight.' And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him.","14":"And he said, 'The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth;","15":"for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard.","16":"And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'","17":"\"When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance","18":"and saw him saying to me, 'Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'","19":"And I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.","20":"And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him.'","21":"And he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'\"","22":"Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, \"Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live.\"","23":"And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,","24":"the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this.","25":"But when they had stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, \"Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?\"","26":"When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, \"What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.\"","27":"So the tribune came and said to him, \"Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?\" And he said, \"Yes.\"","28":"The tribune answered, \"I bought this citizenship for a large sum.\" Paul said, \"But I am a citizen by birth.\"","29":"So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.","30":"But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them."},"23":{"1":"And looking intently at the council, Paul said, \"Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.\"","2":"And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.","3":"Then Paul said to him, \"God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?\"","4":"Those who stood by said, \"Would you revile God's high priest?\"","5":"And Paul said, \"I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'\"","6":"Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, \"Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.\"","7":"And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.","8":"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.","9":"Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, \"We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?\"","10":"And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.","11":"The following night the Lord stood by him and said, \"Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome.\"","12":"When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.","13":"There were more than forty who made this conspiracy.","14":"They went to the chief priests and elders and said, \"We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul.","15":"Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.\"","16":"Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.","17":"Paul called one of the centurions and said, \"Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him.\"","18":"So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, \"Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.\"","19":"The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, \"What is it that you have to tell me?\"","20":"And he said, \"The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him.","21":"But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your consent.\"","22":"So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, \"Tell no one that you have informed me of these things.\"","23":"Then he called two of the centurions and said, \"Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night.","24":"Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor.\"","25":"And he wrote a letter to this effect:","26":"\"Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings.","27":"This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.","28":"And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council.","29":"I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.","30":"And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him.\"","31":"So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.","32":"And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him.","33":"When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.","34":"On reading the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia,","35":"he said, \"I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive.\" And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium."},"24":{"1":"And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul.","2":"And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:\"Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation,","3":"in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude.","4":"But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.","5":"For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.","6":"He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him.","7":"See Footnote","8":"By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him.\"","9":"The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.","10":"And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied:\"Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.","11":"You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,","12":"and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city.","13":"Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me.","14":"But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,","15":"having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.","16":"So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man.","17":"Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings.","18":"While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia--","19":"they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me.","20":"Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council,","21":"other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: 'It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.'\"","22":"But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, \"When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.\"","23":"Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.","24":"After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.","25":"And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, \"Go away for the present. When I get an opportunity I will summon you.\"","26":"At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.","27":"When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison."},"25":{"1":"Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.","2":"And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him,","3":"asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem--because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.","4":"Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly.","5":"\"So,\" said he, \"let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him.\"","6":"After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.","7":"When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove.","8":"Paul argued in his defense, \"Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offense.\"","9":"But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, \"Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me?\"","10":"But Paul said, \"I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourselves know very well.","11":"If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.\"","12":"Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, \"To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.\"","13":"Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus.","14":"And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, \"There is a man left prisoner by Felix,","15":"and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.","16":"I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him.","17":"So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought.","18":"When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed.","19":"Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.","20":"Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them.","21":"But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.\"","22":"Then Agrippa said to Festus, \"I would like to hear the man myself.Tomorrow,\" said he, \"you will hear him.\"","23":"So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.","24":"And Festus said, \"King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.","25":"But I found that he had done nothing deserving death. And as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to go ahead and send him.","26":"But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write.","27":"For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.\""},"26":{"1":"So Agrippa said to Paul, \"You have permission to speak for yourself.\" Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:","2":"\"I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am going to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews,","3":"especially because you are familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.","4":"\"My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews.","5":"They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee.","6":"And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers,","7":"to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king!","8":"Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?","9":"\"I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth.","10":"And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.","11":"And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme, and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities.","12":"\"In this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.","13":"At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me.","14":"And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'","15":"And I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.","16":"But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you,","17":"delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles--to whom I am sending you","18":"to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'","19":"\"Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,","20":"but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance.","21":"For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.","22":"To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:","23":"that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.\"","24":"And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, \"Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind.\"","25":"But Paul said, \"I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words.","26":"For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.","27":"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.\"","28":"And Agrippa said to Paul, \"In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?\"","29":"And Paul said, \"Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am--except for these chains.\"","30":"Then the king rose, and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them.","31":"And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, \"This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment.\"","32":"And Agrippa said to Festus, \"This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.\""},"27":{"1":"And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius.","2":"And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.","3":"The next day we put in at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for.","4":"And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.","5":"And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.","6":"There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board.","7":"We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.","8":"Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.","9":"Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul advised them,","10":"saying, \"Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.\"","11":"But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.","12":"And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.","13":"Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore.","14":"But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land.","15":"And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.","16":"Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship's boat.","17":"After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along.","18":"Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day to jettison the cargo.","19":"And on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.","20":"When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.","21":"Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, \"Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss.","22":"Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.","23":"For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship,","24":"and he said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'","25":"So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.","26":"But we must run aground on some island.\"","27":"When the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land.","28":"So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms. A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms.","29":"And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.","30":"And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the ship's boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,","31":"Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, \"Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.\"","32":"Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it go.","33":"As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, \"Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing.","34":"Therefore I urge you to take some food. It will give you strength, for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.\"","35":"And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat.","36":"Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves.","37":"(We were in all 276 persons in the ship.)","38":"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.","39":"Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore.","40":"So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach.","41":"But striking a reef, they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf.","42":"The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape.","43":"But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land,","44":"and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land."},"28":{"1":"After we were brought safely through, we then learned that the island was called Malta.","2":"The native people showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.","3":"When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.","4":"When the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, \"No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.\"","5":"He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.","6":"They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.","7":"Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days.","8":"It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him.","9":"And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.","10":"They also honored us greatly, and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed.","11":"After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods as a figurehead.","12":"Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.","13":"And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.","14":"There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.","15":"And the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage.","16":"And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.","17":"After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews, and when they had gathered, he said to them, \"Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.","18":"When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.","19":"But because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar--though I had no charge to bring against my nation.","20":"For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain.\"","21":"And they said to him, \"We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you.","22":"But we desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against.\"","23":"When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers. From morning till evening he expounded to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.","24":"And some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved.","25":"And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement: \"The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:","26":"\"'Go to this people, and say, You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive.","27":"For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'","28":"Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.\"","29":"See Footnote","30":"He lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him,","31":"proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance."}},"Romans":{"1":{"1":"Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,","2":"which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,","3":"concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh","4":"and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,","5":"through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,","6":"including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,","7":"To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints:Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.","8":"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.","9":"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you","10":"always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.","11":"For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you--","12":"that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.","13":"I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.","14":"I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.","15":"So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.","16":"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.","17":"For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, \"The righteous shall live by faith.\"","18":"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.","19":"For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.","20":"For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.","21":"For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.","22":"Claiming to be wise, they became fools,","23":"and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.","24":"Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,","25":"because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.","26":"For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;","27":"and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.","28":"And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.","29":"They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,","30":"slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,","31":"foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.","32":"Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them."},"2":{"1":"Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.","2":"We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who do such things.","3":"Do you suppose, O man--you who judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself--that you will escape the judgment of God?","4":"Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?","5":"But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.","6":"He will render to each one according to his works:","7":"to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;","8":"but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.","9":"There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,","10":"but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.","11":"For God shows no partiality.","12":"For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.","13":"For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.","14":"For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.","15":"They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them","16":"on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.","17":"But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God","18":"and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;","19":"and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,","20":"an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--","21":"you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?","22":"You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?","23":"You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.","24":"For, as it is written, \"The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.\"","25":"For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.","26":"So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?","27":"Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law.","28":"For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.","29":"But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God."},"3":{"1":"Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?","2":"Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.","3":"What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?","4":"By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, \"That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.\"","5":"But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)","6":"By no means! For then how could God judge the world?","7":"But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?","8":"And why not do evil that good may come?--as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.","9":"What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin,","10":"as it is written: \"None is righteous, no, not one;","11":"no one understands; no one seeks for God.","12":"All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.\"","13":"\"Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.The venom of asps is under their lips.\"","14":"\"Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.\"","15":"\"Their feet are swift to shed blood;","16":"in their paths are ruin and misery,","17":"and the way of peace they have not known.\"","18":"\"There is no fear of God before their eyes.\"","19":"Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.","20":"For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.","21":"But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it--","22":"the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction:","23":"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,","24":"and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,","25":"whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.","26":"It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.","27":"Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.","28":"For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.","29":"Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,","30":"since God is one. He will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.","31":"Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law."},"4":{"1":"What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?","2":"For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.","3":"For what does the Scripture say? \"Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.\"","4":"Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.","5":"And to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,","6":"just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:","7":"\"Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;","8":"blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.\"","9":"Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.","10":"How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.","11":"He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,","12":"and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.","13":"For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.","14":"For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.","15":"For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.","16":"That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring--not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,","17":"as it is written, \"I have made you the father of many nations\"--in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.","18":"In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, \"So shall your offspring be.\"","19":"He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.","20":"No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,","21":"fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.","22":"That is why his faith was \"counted to him as righteousness.\"","23":"But the words \"it was counted to him\" were not written for his sake alone,","24":"but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,","25":"who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification."},"5":{"1":"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.","2":"Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.","3":"More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,","4":"and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,","5":"and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.","6":"For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.","7":"For one will scarcely die for a righteous person--though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die--","8":"but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.","9":"Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.","10":"For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.","11":"More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.","12":"Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned--","13":"for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law.","14":"Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.","15":"But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many.","16":"And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification.","17":"If, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.","18":"Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.","19":"For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.","20":"Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,","21":"so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."},"6":{"1":"What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?","2":"By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?","3":"Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?","4":"We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.","5":"For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.","6":"We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.","7":"For one who has died has been set free from sin.","8":"Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.","9":"We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.","10":"For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.","11":"So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.","12":"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions.","13":"Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.","14":"For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.","15":"What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!","16":"Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?","17":"But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,","18":"and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.","19":"I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.","20":"When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.","21":"But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.","22":"But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.","23":"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."},"7":{"1":"Or do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to those who know the law--that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives?","2":"Thus a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage.","3":"Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.","4":"Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.","5":"For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.","6":"But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit.","7":"What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, \"You shall not covet.\"","8":"But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. Apart from the law, sin lies dead.","9":"I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died.","10":"The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.","11":"For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.","12":"So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.","13":"Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.","14":"For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin.","15":"I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.","16":"Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good.","17":"So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.","18":"For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.","19":"For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.","20":"Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.","21":"So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.","22":"For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,","23":"but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.","24":"Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?","25":"Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin."},"8":{"1":"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.","2":"For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.","3":"For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,","4":"in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.","5":"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.","6":"To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.","7":"For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.","8":"Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.","9":"You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.","10":"But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.","11":"If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.","12":"So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.","13":"For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.","14":"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.","15":"For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, \"Abba! Father!\"","16":"The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,","17":"and if children, then heirs--heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.","18":"For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.","19":"For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God.","20":"For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope","21":"that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.","22":"For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.","23":"And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.","24":"For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?","25":"But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.","26":"Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.","27":"And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.","28":"And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.","29":"For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.","30":"And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.","31":"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?","32":"He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?","33":"Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.","34":"Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died--more than that, who was raised--who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.","35":"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?","36":"As it is written, \"For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.\"","37":"No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.","38":"For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,","39":"nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."},"9":{"1":"I am speaking the truth in Christ--I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit--","2":"that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.","3":"For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.","4":"They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.","5":"To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.","6":"But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel,","7":"and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but \"Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.\"","8":"This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring.","9":"For this is what the promise said: \"About this time next year I will return and Sarah shall have a son.\"","10":"And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,","11":"though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad--in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of his call--","12":"she was told, \"The older will serve the younger.\"","13":"As it is written, \"Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.\"","14":"What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!","15":"For he says to Moses, \"I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.\"","16":"So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.","17":"For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, \"For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.\"","18":"So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.","19":"You will say to me then, \"Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?\"","20":"But who are you, O man, to answer back to God?

That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith;","31":"but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law.","32":"Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works.

And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?","15":"And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, \"How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!\"","16":"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, \"Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?\"","17":"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.","18":"But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for \"Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.\"","19":"But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, \"I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry.\"","20":"Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, \"I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.\"","21":"But of Israel he says, \"All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.\""},"11":{"1":"I ask, then, has God rejected his people?

Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,","8":"as it is written, \"God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day.\"","9":"And David says, \"Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;","10":"let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever.\"","11":"So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means!

Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry","14":"in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.","15":"For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?","16":"If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.","17":"But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,","18":"do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.","19":"Then you will say, \"Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\"","20":"That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe.","21":"For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.","22":"Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.","23":"And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.","24":"For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.","25":"Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.","26":"And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, \"The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob\";","27":"\"and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\"","28":"As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake.

This is my rule in all the churches.","18":"Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.","19":"For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God.","20":"Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called.","21":"Were you a slave when called? Do not be concerned about it. But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.","22":"For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a slave of Christ.","23":"You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.","24":"So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.","25":"Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.","26":"I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is.","27":"Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.","28":"But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that.","29":"This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none,","30":"and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods,","31":"and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.","32":"I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord.","33":"But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife,","34":"and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband.","35":"I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.","36":"If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry--it is no sin.","37":"But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.","38":"So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.","39":"A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.","40":"Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is.

But some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.","8":"Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.","9":"But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.","10":"For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?","11":"And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.","12":"Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.","13":"Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble."},"9":{"1":"Am I not free?

Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?","8":"Do I say these things on human authority? Does not the Law say the same?","9":"For it is written in the Law of Moses, \"You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.\" Is it for oxen that God is concerned?","10":"Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.","11":"If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?","12":"If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more?Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.","13":"Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings?","14":"In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.","15":"But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting.","16":"For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!","17":"For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but not of my own will, I am still entrusted with a stewardship.","18":"What then is my reward? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.","19":"For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them.","20":"To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law.","21":"To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.","22":"To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some.","23":"I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.","24":"Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but only one receives the prize?

For her hair is given to her for a covering.","16":"If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.","17":"But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.","18":"For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part,","19":"for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.","20":"When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.","21":"For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk.","22":"What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.","23":"For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,","24":"and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, \"This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\"","25":"In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\"","26":"For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.","27":"Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.","28":"Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.","29":"For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.","30":"That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.","31":"But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged.","32":"But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.","33":"So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another--","34":"if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home--so that when you come together it will not be for judgment.

But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,","25":"that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.","26":"If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.","27":"Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.","28":"And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues.","29":"Are all apostles?

For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself.","9":"Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.","10":"He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again.","11":"You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.","12":"For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you.","13":"For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and acknowledge and I hope you will fully acknowledge--","14":"just as you did partially acknowledge us, that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.","15":"Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace.","16":"I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea.","17":"Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say \"Yes, yes\" and \"No, no\" at the same time?","18":"As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No.","19":"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes.","20":"For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory.","21":"And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us,","22":"and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.","23":"But I call God to witness against me--it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth.","24":"Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith."},"2":{"1":"For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you.","2":"For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?","3":"And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.","4":"For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.","5":"Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure--not to put it too severely--to all of you.","6":"For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough,","7":"so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.","8":"So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.","9":"For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.","10":"Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,","11":"so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.","12":"When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord,","13":"my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there.

Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed day by day.","17":"For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,","18":"as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen.

At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.","9":"But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.","10":"For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.","11":"For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one origin. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers,","12":"saying, \"I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.\"","13":"And again, \"I will put my trust in him.\"And again, \"Behold, I and the children God has given me.\"","14":"Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,","15":"and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.","16":"For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham.","17":"Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.","18":"For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted."},"3":{"1":"Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,","2":"who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house.","3":"For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses--as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.","4":"(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)","5":"Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,","6":"but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.","7":"Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, \"Today, if you hear his voice,","8":"do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,","9":"where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works","10":"for forty years. Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, 'They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways.'","11":"As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest.'\"","12":"Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.","13":"But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called \"today,\" that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.","14":"For we share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.","15":"As it is said, \"Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.\"","16":"For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses?","17":"And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?","18":"And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?","19":"So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief."},"4":{"1":"Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it.","2":"For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.","3":"For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, \"As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest,'\"although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.","4":"For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: \"And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.\"","5":"And again in this passage he said, \"They shall not enter my rest.\"","6":"Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,","7":"again he appoints a certain day, \"Today,\" saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, \"Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.\"","8":"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on.","9":"So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,","10":"for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.","11":"Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.","12":"For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.","13":"And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.","14":"Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.","15":"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.","16":"Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."},"5":{"1":"For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.","2":"He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness.","3":"Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people.","4":"And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.","5":"So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, \"You are my Son, today I have begotten you\";","6":"as he says also in another place, \"You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.\"","7":"In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.","8":"Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered.","9":"And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him,","10":"being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.","11":"About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.","12":"For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food,","13":"for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child.","14":"But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil."},"6":{"1":"Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,","2":"and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.","3":"And this we will do if God permits.","4":"For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit,","5":"and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,","6":"if they then fall away, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.","7":"For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.","8":"But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.","9":"Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things--things that belong to salvation.","10":"For God is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love that you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.","11":"And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,","12":"so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.","13":"For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,","14":"saying, \"Surely I will bless you and multiply you.\"","15":"And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise.","16":"For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation.","17":"So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath,","18":"so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us.","19":"We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,","20":"where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."},"7":{"1":"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,","2":"and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.","3":"He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.","4":"See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils!","5":"And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham.","6":"But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.","7":"It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.","8":"In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives.","9":"One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,","10":"for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.","11":"Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?","12":"For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.","13":"For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.","14":"For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.","15":"This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,","16":"who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life.","17":"For it is witnessed of him, \"You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.\"","18":"On the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness","19":"(for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.","20":"And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath,","21":"but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him: \"The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever.'\"","22":"This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant.","23":"The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office,","24":"but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.","25":"Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.","26":"For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.","27":"He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself.","28":"For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever."},"8":{"1":"Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,","2":"a minister in the holy places, in the true tent that the Lord set up, not man.","3":"For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.","4":"Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.","5":"They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, \"See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.\"","6":"But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.","7":"For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.","8":"For he finds fault with them when he says: \"Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,","9":"not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not continue in my covenant, and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.","10":"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.","11":"And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor and each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.","12":"For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.\"","13":"In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away."},"9":{"1":"Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness.","2":"For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place.","3":"Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place,","4":"having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.","5":"Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.","6":"These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties,","7":"but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people.","8":"By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing","9":"(which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,","10":"but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.","11":"But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation)","12":"he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.","13":"For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh,","14":"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.","15":"Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.","16":"For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.","17":"For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.","18":"Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood.","19":"For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,","20":"saying, \"This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.\"","21":"And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship.","22":"Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.","23":"Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.","24":"For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.","25":"Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own,","26":"for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.","27":"And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment,","28":"so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him."},"10":{"1":"For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near.","2":"Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sin?","3":"But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin every year.","4":"For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.","5":"Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, \"Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for me;","6":"in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.","7":"Then I said, 'Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.'\"","8":"When he said above, \"You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings\" (these are offered according to the law),","9":"then he added, \"Behold, I have come to do your will.\" He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.","10":"And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.","11":"And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.","12":"But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,","13":"waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet.","14":"For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.","15":"And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,","16":"\"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on their minds,\"","17":"then he adds, \"I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.\"","18":"Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.","19":"Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus,","20":"by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh,","21":"and since we have a great priest over the house of God,","22":"let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.","23":"Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.","24":"And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,","25":"not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.","26":"For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,","27":"but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.","28":"Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses.","29":"How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has spurned the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?","30":"For we know him who said, \"Vengeance is mine; I will repay.\" And again, \"The Lord will judge his people.\"","31":"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.","32":"But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings,","33":"sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.","34":"For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.","35":"Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.","36":"For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.","37":"For, \"Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay;","38":"but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.\"","39":"But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls."},"11":{"1":"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.","2":"For by it the people of old received their commendation.","3":"By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.","4":"By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks.","5":"By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God.","6":"And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.","7":"By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.","8":"By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.","9":"By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise.","10":"For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God.","11":"By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.","12":"Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.","13":"These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.","14":"For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.","15":"If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.","16":"But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.","17":"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son,","18":"of whom it was said, \"Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.\"","19":"He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.","20":"By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.","21":"By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff.","22":"By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.","23":"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.","24":"By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,","25":"choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.","26":"He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.","27":"By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.","28":"By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.","29":"By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned.","30":"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.","31":"By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.","32":"And what more shall I say?

Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life.","36":"Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.","37":"They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated--","38":"of whom the world was not worthy--wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.","39":"And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised,","40":"since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect."},"12":{"1":"Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,","2":"looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.","3":"Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.","4":"In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.","5":"And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? \"My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him.","6":"For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives.\"","7":"It is for discipline that you have to endure.

These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb,","5":"and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are blameless.","6":"Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.","7":"And he said with a loud voice, \"Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water.\"","8":"Another angel, a second, followed, saying, \"Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality.\"","9":"And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, \"If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,","10":"he also will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.","11":"And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.\"","12":"Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.","13":"And I heard a voice from heaven saying, \"Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.Blessed indeed,\" says the Spirit, \"that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!\"","14":"Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.","15":"And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, \"Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.\"","16":"So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the earth was reaped.","17":"Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.","18":"And another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has authority over the fire, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, \"Put in your sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.\"","19":"So the angel swung his sickle across the earth and gathered the grape harvest of the earth and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.","20":"And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress, as high as a horse's bridle, for 1,600 stadia."},"15":{"1":"Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished.","2":"And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire--and also those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands.","3":"And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, \"Great and amazing are your deeds, O Lord God the Almighty! Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations!","4":"Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.\"","5":"After this I looked, and the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven was opened,","6":"and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues, clothed in pure, bright linen, with golden sashes around their chests.","7":"And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever,","8":"and the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished."},"16":{"1":"Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, \"Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.\"","2":"So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful sores came upon the people who bore the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.","3":"The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died that was in the sea.","4":"The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.","5":"And I heard the angel in charge of the waters say, \"Just are you, O Holy One, who is and who was, for you brought these judgments.","6":"For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!\"","7":"And I heard the altar saying, \"Yes, Lord God the Almighty, true and just are your judgments!\"","8":"The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people with fire.","9":"They were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.","10":"The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish","11":"and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. They did not repent of their deeds.","12":"The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east.","13":"And I saw, coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.","14":"For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty.","15":"(\"Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!\")","16":"And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.","17":"The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, \"It is done!\"","18":"And there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such as there had never been since man was on the earth, so great was that earthquake.","19":"The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered Babylon the great, to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.","20":"And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found.","21":"And great hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people; and they cursed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague was so severe."},"17":{"1":"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, \"Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who is seated on many waters,","2":"with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and with the wine of whose sexual immorality the dwellers on earth have become drunk.\"","3":"And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns.","4":"The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.","5":"And on her forehead was written a name of mystery: \"Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth's abominations.\"","6":"And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I marveled greatly.","7":"But the angel said to me, \"Why do you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.","8":"The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come.","9":"This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated;","10":"they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while.","11":"As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.","12":"And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast.","13":"These are of one mind and hand over their power and authority to the beast.","14":"They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.\"","15":"And the angel said to me, \"The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages.","16":"And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire,","17":"for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and handing over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.","18":"And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth.\""},"18":{"1":"After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was made bright with his glory.","2":"And he called out with a mighty voice, \"Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast.","3":"For all nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.\"","4":"Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, \"Come out of her, my people, lest you take part in her sins, lest you share in her plagues;","5":"for her sins are heaped high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.","6":"Pay her back as she herself has paid back others, and repay her double for her deeds; mix a double portion for her in the cup she mixed.","7":"As she glorified herself and lived in luxury, so give her a like measure of torment and mourning, since in her heart she says, 'I sit as a queen, I am no widow, and mourning I shall never see.'","8":"For this reason her plagues will come in a single day, death and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for mighty is the Lord God who has judged her.\"","9":"And the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning.","10":"They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, \"Alas! Alas! You great city, you mighty city, Babylon! For in a single hour your judgment has come.\"","11":"And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore,","12":"cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles of ivory, all kinds of articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble,","13":"cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls.","14":"\"The fruit for which your soul longed has gone from you, and all your delicacies and your splendors are lost to you, never to be found again!\"","15":"The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud,","16":"\"Alas, alas, for the great city that was clothed in fine linen, in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, with jewels, and with pearls!","17":"For in a single hour all this wealth has been laid waste.\"And all shipmasters and seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off","18":"and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, \"What city was like the great city?\"","19":"And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, crying out, \"Alas, alas, for the great city where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her wealth! For in a single hour she has been laid waste.","20":"Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, for God has given judgment for you against her!\"","21":"Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, \"So will Babylon the great city be thrown down with violence, and will be found no more;","22":"and the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters, will be heard in you no more, and a craftsman of any craft will be found in you no more, and the sound of the mill will be heard in you no more,","23":"and the light of a lamp will shine in you no more, and the voice of bridegroom and bride will be heard in you no more, for your merchants were the great ones of the earth, and all nations were deceived by your sorcery.","24":"And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on earth.\""},"19":{"1":"After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, \"Hallelujah!

The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.\"","4":"And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, saying, \"Amen. Hallelujah!\"","5":"And from the throne came a voice saying, \"Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, small and great.\"","6":"Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying out, \"Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.","7":"Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready;","8":"it was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure\"--for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.","9":"And the angel said to me, \"Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.\" And he said to me, \"These are the true words of God.\"","10":"Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, \"You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.\" For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.","11":"Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.","12":"His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself.","13":"He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God.","14":"And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses.","15":"From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.","16":"On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.","17":"Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, \"Come, gather for the great supper of God,","18":"to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.\"","19":"And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army.","20":"And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.","21":"And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh."},"20":{"1":"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain.","2":"And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,","3":"and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.","4":"Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.","5":"The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.","6":"Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.","7":"And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison","8":"and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.","9":"And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them,","10":"and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.","11":"Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it.
